Version 0.4.3                           "Everyone loves kittens"
- New features:

  * Request-Strictness is now set to 10000 by default.  This should
    cause the internal problem resolver to produce more sensible
    solutions when run from the command-line. (Closes: #385453)

- Bug fixes:

  * Don't crash when trying to display text in the internal pager in
    which a tab character appears in a column that is not a multiple
    of 8. (Closes: #383488, #383549)

  * Don't crash after su-ing to root. (Closes: #382090)

  * Don't crash when saving the state while a non-default version of a
    package that has no default version at all (e.g., exists only in
    experimental) is selected for installation. (Closes: #383767, #384136)

  * Eliminate duplicate entries from the "provided by" list displayed
    by "aptitude show". (Closes: #384001)

  * Grotesquely hack around ugly behavior in 256-color terms by
    limiting the maximum number of foreground/background colors to 8.
    (Closes: #384699)

  * Fix the incorrect claim in the documentation that "l" is the
    shortcut to remove the limit from the display.

  * Make the in-menu hotkey for "mark upgradable" not conflict with
    "update package list".

  * Use groff escapes for extended characters when generating manpages
    so that they look better in non-English locales. (Closes: #383463)

  * Use the built-in Docbook XSLT templates to italicise <replacable>
    tags in manpages.  This is asserted to produce more correct
    output.

- Translation updates:

  * Dzongkha (Closes: #382606)

  * French

  * Galician (Closes: #381989)

  * German

  * Hungarian (Closes: #383584)

  * Khmer (Closes: #374919)

  * Swedish (Closes: #382992, #383630)

  * Vietnamese (Closes: #382333, #383586)

[7/31/2006]
Version 0.4.2                           "Rock on, Monkeyverse"
- New features:

  * Added a command to cancel all pending actions from the full-screen
    UI (an analogue of "keep-all" at the command line).

  * Added an option "Aptitude::UI::ViewTabs" that controls whether the
    "tabs" at the top of the screen are displayed. (Closes: #344569)

  * Make the lockfile default to /var/lock/aptitude as per
    FHS. (Closes: #160418)

  * Add support for searching in the on-line user's manual.
    (Closes: #364306)

- Bug fixes:

  * Fix compilation errors with gcc 4.1. (Closes: #357557)

  * Fix compilation errors with gcc 4.2. (Closes: #369382)

  * Fix crashes that occurred during update (and perhaps install)
    operations if a problem resolver was active.
    (Closes: #346380, #348541, #348481, #376573)

  * Don't crash when trying to install packages off multiple
    CDs. (Closes: #349869)

  * Handle NULLs being returned from get_changelog_from_source
    (Closes: #343488).

  * Don't crash when moving the selection up if the current selection
    is invalid (Closes: #343676).

  * Disable bullet-detection by default, since it is
    backwards-incompatible in a bad way that cannot be easily solved.
    (Closes: #373888)

  * Make bullet-detection better defined by requiring exactly one
    space after the bullet (subsequent spaces cause lines to be
    literally formatted; without this, literal lines in bulleted
    paragraphs aren't possible).

  * Make the behavior of "aptitude show" more intuitive: state
    information corresponds to the Version displayed, and the current
    version is selected by default if the package is
    currently installed. (Closes: #375393, #372796)

  * Use PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE instead of PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE_NP
    so we compile on the Hurd (Closes: #361439).

  * Fix saving/restoring states when a non-default version is being
    freshly installed.

  * Correct how the progress indicator is updated when rebuilding the
    cache.

  * Don't read the package lists on startup when they're about to be
    discarded to download new ones. (Closes: #366884)

  * Fix incorrect behavior in the command-line changelog routine,
    triggered by pending errors that weren't being dumped.
    (Closes: #379903)

  * Fix several places where error reporting via Errno was broken.
    (Closes: #350264)

  * Correctly handle scrollbar updates after resizing text layouts.
    (Closes: #347445)

  * Fix how the internal pager renders tabs. (Closes: #351323)

  * Remove the pkgAcqFileSane class; the functionality it provides is
    now available in libapt -- and better implemented, so this
    (Closes: #299127).

  * Use correct xml in the manual.

  * Add a (non-default) target to build printable documentation.

  * Use UTF-8 to output the manpage.

- Translation updates:

  * Add some plural form support.

  * Fix the P_() localization macro.

  * Use po4a for the manual. (Closes: #351643)

[12/8/2005]
Version 0.4.1                           "Divers Alarums"
- New features:

  * Assertion failures should print the failing assertion after
    shutting down curses rather than before.

  * The --purge-unused option is now provided as a synonym for
    -o Aptitude::Purge-Unused=true.

  * aptitude will now support ddtp if it is compiled against a version
    of apt that supports ddtp.

  * Setting the Aptitude::Cmdline::Resolver-Dump option to a filename
    will cause the command-line mode of the program to dump a snapshot
    of the resolver state to that file before attempting to resolve
    dependencies.

  * Setting the Aptitude::GC-Debug option will cause the garbage
    collector to print voluminous debugging information as it searches
    for unused packages.

- Bug fixes:

  * Eliminate two deadlocks caused by the background resolver thread
    trying to wait for itself. (Closes: #340067, #342319)

  * Never select a version that was removed but not purged and is no
    longer available as a candidate version. (Closes: #340385)

  * Eliminate a corner case where the resolver could produce solutions
    that were supersets of previous solutions.

  * If an EOF is encountered while waiting for a media-change from the
    command-line, signal media change failure instead of aborting.

  * Don't ever use the minibuffer to display the list of packages
    adjusted by the resolver (Closes: #341292).

  * If the menu bar is auto-hidden, don't automatically unhide it when
    the user clicks in the first row of the display; instead, pass the
    clicks to the sub-widget. (Closes: #341475)

  * Enable colors on terminals where COLOR_PAIRS < COLORS*COLORS but
    COLOR_PAIRS >= 64.

  * Honor -y when the resolver runs out of time at the command-line.

  * Make "cancel" at the "download complete" dialog actually cancel.

  * Fix a portability bug due to cross-platform variation in the
    members of sigaction (Closes: #337536)

  * Fix how keybindings are parsed: keybinding names are now
    case-insensitive and single-character keybindings are parsed
    correctly. (Closes: #339131)

  * Add spaces after various minibuffer prompts.

  * Add a link from the search patterns documentation to the
    command-line reference.

  * When saving the package states, properly handle the case in which
    the state file didn't previously exist. (Closes: #337869)

  * Don't segfault when the user updates the package lists while a
    solution examiner is open. (Closes: #338441)

  * Trust any package version for which at least one source is trusted
    (Closes: #337982).

  * Work around apt bug #339533 to avoid an aptitude
    segfault. (Closes: #339648)

  * Fixed the assertion failure message printed when an inconsistency
    is detected because a supposedly broken dependency isn't broken (it was incorrect).

  * If a --schedule-only operation fails, print any errors that
    occurred before exiting.

  * Document the new backslash behavior in help.txt. (Closes: #337810)

  * Document that "default" can be used as a background color.

  * Correct the names of the problem-resolver control knobs in the
    documentation.

[11/4/2005]
Version 0.4.0                           "Aptitude Below Zero"

- New features:

  * The primary binding of the menu toggle command is now Control-t
    instead of f10.  All old bindings still work, but this means that
    the binding displayed at the top of the screen will work on all
    terminals. (Closes: #147862, #335034)

  * By default, the solution that reverts all user actions is
    discarded entirely.

  * The "changelog", "download", and "show" command-line actions
    recognize "-t <archive>" and handle it by acting as if
    "/<archive>" had been appended to each argument of the
    command. (Closes: #334096)

  * When "show" cannot locate a package by name, it now exits with an
    error instead of exiting with status 0.

  * When the user requests a particular version of a package, "show"
    will display only that version, even if the verbosity level would
    normally cause all versions to be displayed.

  * Highlight stuff that looks like bullets when viewing a changelog
    file.

  * Doxyfile.in is distributed, so the doxygen documentation should be
    buildable from the distributed tarball.

  * Added a Keep-Recommends option that is analogous to Keep-Suggests:
    it doesn't cause recommendations to be automatically installed,
    but it does cause them to be held on the system by the garbage
    collector if they were automatically installed.

- Bug fixes:

  * Forward and reverse dependency lists are sorted by name and
    version.

  * Made page-up in a list of packages properly trigger the update of
    all connected information.

  * "search" now completely ignores fake packages (Closes: #337407).

  * The code to parse a bullet list in a description now knows how to
    handle any number of spaces following a bullet (including
    zero). (Closes: #337344)

  * Don't hide the preview screen when downloading stuff other than
    packages. (Closes: #334343)

  * Deal sanely with changelogs and other formatted text that
    contains newlines or tabs.

  * More real and potential UTF-8 display problems fixed.
    (Closes: #317119)

  * Fix some anomalies in the display of the menu bar's left/right
    arrows.

  * Corrected how the sigc++ version against which the program was
    compiled is reported.

  * Added "install" to the manpage synopsis. (Closes: #336584)

  * Cleaned up some parts of the resolver interface and wrote
    top-level API documentation for it.

- Translation updates:

  * sv is now included in ALL_LINGUAS.

  * Translation updates:

[10/14/2005]
Version 0.3.5.1                         "Slantwise Cacophany"

- Bug fixes:

  * Corrected several trivial but fatal bugs in the build and install
    system.

  * Document 'aptitude reinstall' in the --help output. (Closes: #333872)

- Translation updates:

  * Add a Swedish translation of help.txt. (Closes: #333918)

[10/13/2005]
Version 0.3.5                           "Yoink"

   Upstream aptitude development is now stored in darcs.  See the
   documentation for additional details.

- New features:

  * Redesigned how versions are handled in the pattern matching
    language.  The set of versions matched against is more uniform
    (typically all the versions of a package).  This set is narrowed
    at appropriate times; for instance, reverse dependency matchers
    will only pass those versions that assert a dependency into their
    subexpression.  You can manually narrow the set by selecting
    versions with ~S, and manually widen it by using ~W.

  * Forward and reverse dependency matchers can be restricted to only
    broken dependencies.

  * The version matcher (~V) has support for matching the current,
    target, or candidate version of a package (in addition to matching
    a regexp against the version number).

  * Add a canned package view that only displays packages which are
    targets of unsatisfied Recommends.

  * Sort reverse and forward dependencies by package name and version
    number.

  * In the command-line preview, display {p} next to packages that are
    being purged.

  * More command-line compatibility with apt-get for -q and
    --quiet. (Closes: #217477)

  * Only override $HOME with getpwuid if $HOME/.aptitude does not
    exist.  NOTE: this doesn't work right now with the auto-su-to-root
    behavior, because that resets $HOME.  You have been warned.

  * Add a sorting policy that sorts packages by version number.

- Bug fixes:

  * The problem resolver will no longer try to install versions of
    packages that don't actually exist.  In particular, it won't try
    to install packages that were removed but not purged, so their
    configuration files and metadata stayed on the system.

  * Eliminated a reference-to-freed-memory segfault caused by passing
    unsafe references to widgets around. (Closes: #331400)

  * Don't crash when the user asks to see the changelog of a
    non-installed package.  (Closes: #331245)

  * Don't crash when the cache is closed while a changelog is being
    downloaded (for instance, if a changelog is downloaded while
    packages are being installed).

  * Encode match results as std::strings instead of const char *s, as
    some of the buffers are destroyed before the get_match routine
    exits.

  * Don't reopen the cache after a download unless it's necessary.
    (Closes: #332708)

  * Version items are now styled in the same way as package items.

  * Explicitly keep the search dialog alive while its Ok handler is
    executing, so that the "actually search" signal isn't disconnected
    too soon and searching by clicking Ok works.  (Closes: #332179)
    Similar fixes to other stock dialogs.

  * Use the right encoding when converting the name of a dependency
    type to a wide character string.  (Closes: #331199)

  * Write out the descriptions of solution elements using
    wide-character functions.

  * Ensure that string inputs in the configuration dialogs are always
    visible. (Closes: #331200)

  * Read the debtags vocabulary file from /var/lib instead of
    /usr/share, and hint that the user should install debtags to make
    the error go away. (Closes: #331408)

  * Fix the parser of the backwards-compatibility filter grouping
    policy. (Closes: #331404)

  * Really bypass the authentication prompt if Ignore-Trust-Violations
    is true. (Closes: #332883)

  * Don't duplicate packages in the filter policy.

  * Accept archive or version specifiers with installauto (+M) as well
    as install.

  * Document ~t.

[9/30/2005]
Version 0.3.4                           "Up The Airy Mountain"

- New features:

  * The solution examiner is now a view coequal with package trees and
    other views rather than a pop-up dialog box.

  * From the solution examiner, you can select individual actions
    within a solution and approve or reject them to influence the
    future course of the resolver; you can also access quite a bit
    more information, such as explanations of why actions were
    included in the solution and alternatives to the actions.

  * Rebalanced the default resolver weights to focus it more on
    generating a solution quickly and less on generating a "good"
    solution.

  * The problem resolver now understands about Recommendations.  It
    will try to solve Recommendations that are currently satisfied or
    that are only present in a newly installed version of a package
    and not the current version, but it can also leave them broken
    (with a penalty to the resulting solution).

  * The visual mode of the program is now threaded: in particular,
    long-running tasks such as downloading packages and resolving
    dependencies are run in the background and no longer cause the
    interface to become nonresponsive.

    This also eliminates the need to use recursive main loops, and
    hence this Closes: #136973.

  * Holds are now implicitly cancelled by the "Keep" command in visual
    mode (but not from the command line). (Closes: #326949)

  * Search patterns now treat whitespace as a term separator (but
    whitespace between a pattern code and its argument is ignored).
    To search for literal whitespace, use double quotes or
    tilde-escaping.

  * You can now search for text in internal text pagers (for instance,
    when viewing a package's Changelog).

  * A generic grouping policy based on search patterns is available.
    (Closes: #156065)

  * Selecting a package version other than the current version and the
    default candidate version explicitly is now sticky. (Closes:
    #158771)

  * Debtags support is available: tags are shown after a package's
    description, you can search for them (~G), and a tag-based grouping
    policy is available. (Closes: #243830)

  * More predefined package views are available: a flat view and a
    view based on debtags.

  * The command-line now has "keep" and "keep-all" commands (the
    latter cancels all sticky actions that are queued on packages).
    (Closes: #312923)

  * From the command-line, changelogs can be downloaded by source
    package name in addition to the binary package name.

  * The command-line option "--schedule-only" will write the
    commands you ask for to the database and then exit without
    downloading, installing, or removing anything.  (Closes: #312249)

  * You can search both backwards and forwards (the backslash key
    has been changed from 'repeat last search' to 'search backwards').
    (Closes: #323239)

  * You can repeat searches in all pagers and dialogs.
    (Closes: #270699)

  * You can now find downgraded packages using "~adowngrade".

  * aptitude now works with the apt status reporting patch from
    Michael Vogt.

  * The rather useless "missing" grouping policy is no longer
    necessary and has been deprecated, although it is still recognized
    by the parser for backwards-compatibility.

  * You can now access the default background color under the name
    "default" when altering styles.

    The default foreground color is unavailable; for technical reasons
    it's impossible for aptitude to support both at once in a standard
    X terminal.  However, I believe that most of the requests for this
    feature stemmed from an interest in terminals with transparent
    backgrounds; if you set the default widget style to "bg default;",
    aptitude should work reasonably well with transparent terminals
    now.  (Closes: #161872)

  * Every combination of the package state and the highlighted status
    of the package now has a separate style, which should allow a
    great deal more flexibility for people who don't like the
    defaults.

  * aptitude now automatically keeps a single backup of the pkgstates
    file, in the same manner as dpkg. (Closes: #316460)

  * Warn the user once when they modify the cache while the program is
    in read-only mode.  (Closes: #175408)

  * The resolver keystroke hints at the bottom of the screen dim out
    when they're not available.

  * Menus and menu bars behave more gracefully on small terminals:
    menus can be scrolled up and down, and menu bars can be scrolled
    left and right.

  * You can automatically purge packages which are removed because
    they are unused.  This option is dangerous and it is recommended
    that you leave it off.  (Closes: #275150)

  * Timestamps in the aptitude log file include the time zone.
    (Closes: #318501)

  * If libparse-debianchangelog-perl is installed, aptitude will parse
    changelogs and highlight newer versions of the package. (Closes:
    #290692)

- Bug fixes:

  * aptitude no longer goes bonkers when you suspend and resume it.
    (Closes: #137311, #169479)

  * Use the password database instead of $HOME to find the user's home
    directory; this will fix the mode 0700 root-owned files that
    people were seeing.  (Closes: #272429, #274216, #285334)

  * Temporary files and directories are created in /tmp instead of
    cluttering ~/.aptitude/.tmp. (Closes: #146485, #245348)

  * If becoming root fails, re-load the file containing the current
    selections so that they don't get lost. (Closes: #281232)

  * ~akeep now matches any package that no action will be performed
    on, including packages that are not installed.

  * The apt error dialog now properly appears every time errors occur.

  * Fix several UTF-8 related display bugs. (Closes: #317115)

  * The cursor is now placed correctly again.

  * Get the width of the screen right in a number of places when
    running in command-line mode. (Closes: #230187)

  * Set packages that were to be removed because they were unused back
    to manual mode when the user keeps them at their current
    version. (Closes: #278490)

  * Various bugs in the resolver fixed.

  * Fix a crash that occurred when aptitude got EOF on standard input;
    the program now just aborts. (Closes: #318749)

  * Fix a redundancy in some text at the command line. (Closes: #318396)

  * Don't segfault if errors are encountered in the initialization
    routines. (Closes: #309445)

  * When there are currently broken packages, print an explanation of
    why the command-line upgrade is aborting instead of just silently
    terminating. (Closes: #316027)

  * Fix the return value of 'aptitude clean'. (Closes: #274098)

  * Terminate abnormally if the user tries to show a non-existant
    package or if other errors come up. (Closes: #301291)

  * The startup progress bar no longer hangs around too long.

  * The message displayed when the installation procedure encounters
    errors is somewhat more levelheaded. (Closes: #230188)

  * Add support for making the command-line mode "quiet" (option -q).
    (Closes: #217477)

  * If -s is passed on the command-line, the cache will always be
    opened read-only, even if the user is root.

  * Hold onto the apt lock while running reportbug, so we don't have
    to reload the cache and discard user selections. (Closes: #304748)

  * Don't use terminal tricks to display continually updating progress
    indicator if stdin is not a tty. (Closes: #276767)

  * For some years now, aptitude has not freed memory belonging to
    widget objects.  This is now fixed, and an explicit memory
    management model for widgets based on reference-counting has been
    hammered out.

  * Fix the manpage's SEE ALSO entry for the reference manual.
    (Closes: #265723)

  * Apply typo fixes for the documentation. (Closes: #268916)

  * Explicitly document that ~a only matches the current state of a
    package. (Closes: #311290)

  * Delete some unnecessary text that both lacks a trailing newline
    and is rather rude. (Closes: #295924)

- Translation updates:

  * Czech (Closes: #330014)

  * Danish (Closes: #317824)

  * Finnish (Closes: #316225)

  * French (Closes: #318906)

  * Romanian (Closes: #318947)

  * Vietnamese (Closes: #316994, #319702, #322276)

- Internal changes:

  * Migrated all build scripts to automake-1.9 and the latest gettext
    version.

  * Restructured the resolver code to be far more legible.

  * Much optimization of the problem resolver, including:
    - Detect logical conflicts to avoid going down the same blind
      alleys over and over.

    - Use shared-memory data structures to greatly decrease virtual
      memory usage (memory usage in test cases that used to take
      hundreds of megabytes is now negligible).

    - When ordering solutions, use the score first (since it's
      essentially a hash of the information in the solution), and only
      examine the incoming solutions in their entirety if they have
      the same score.

  * Split the horrible download code into a much more pleasant group
    of "download process" classes with an interface that's generic
    enough to allow the frontend to implement a general "execute
    download process" function.  The new download classes were pushed
    down into the generic level.

  * Split generic/ into generic/util and generic/apt.

  * Restructured the way grouping policies and matchers are parsed to
    allow them to work together without unpleasant surprises.

  * A test suite (based on cppunit) is now available; most of the
    tests are currently of backend code.

  * Most dynamic casting in menu_tree was eliminated; now it just
    checks whether the selected item implements the menu_redirect
    interface and proxies for it (as far as the package and solution
    item menu commands go) if so.

  * Exceptions can now dynamically generate a program backtrace --
    however, in order for this to be useful, you have to have many
    more symbols compiled into the program (in tests, this DOUBLED the
    final executable size).  To get a binary that will generate a
    backtrace for uncaught exceptions, compile with
    --enable-dynamic-backtrace.

Version 0.3.3         "Universal Text Format Ate My Package Manager"

- New features:

  * Full support for UTF-8 and other wide character locales.  Anything
    that doesn't work (aside from bug #316663 in curses) is a bug.
    Some languages might lack full support, as I'm releasing this
    before the translators have time to catch up!

  * Colors and text styles are now selected in a much more flexible
    way.  Each visual can independently alter or override each setting
    of its surrounding text.  Foreground and background colors can be
    set independently.

- Translation updates:

  * Chinese (Simplified) (Closes: #314330)

  * Chinese (Traditional) (Closes: #311587)

  * Czech (Closes: #314328)

  * Dutch (Closes: #315376, #316279)

  * Finnish (Closes: #312311, #313450)

  * German (Closes: #313663)

  * Lithuanian (Closes: #314643)

  * Norwegian Bokmal (Closes: #313459)

  * Norwegian nynorsk (Closes: #315988)

  * Polish (Closes: #315338)

  * Portuguese (Closes: #315486)

  * Russian (Closes: #313619)

  * Slovak (Closes: #309824)

  * Spanish (Closes: #313412)

  * Vietnamese (Closes: #313321)

- Bug fixes:

  * Fix a case where different packages would be selected on startup
    than on shutdown. (Closes: #315359)

  * Fix several longstanding coding errors that caused the progress
    bar to disappear/freeze while the program was starting up.

  * Don't crash when trying to display information about packages
    with no Archive.  (Closes: #312533)

  * Allow the user to cancel a media change.  (Closes: #315885)

  * Be more explicit in warning the user that they are in read-only
    mode.  (Closes: #313417)

  * Typo fix in cmdline_prompt (Closes: #313322)

  * Adjusted the input polling frequency in the download code; the
    program should feel a bit more responsive while it's downloading.

[5/1/2005]
Version 0.3.2         "Eat cold logic, feeble dependency problem!"

- New features:

  * Finally tossed the APT problem resolver over the side.  aptitude
    now has its own problem resolver, with (among other things) the
    following features:

      - It's restartable and nondestructive -- meaning that if you
        don't like its suggestion, you can ask it to find another one.

      - It understands how to resolve dependencies by installing
        non-default package versions.  For instance, it can figure out
        that to install aptitude from experimental, you need to also
        install apt and synaptic from experimental (if unstable's
        synaptic is installed).

      - The priorities of the resolver are fully configurable; see the
        configuration file section of the reference manual.

      - It's generic: in theory you could apply the code to many
        package systems, including some that are not APT-based.

      - It has a formal model of dependencies underlying it; see
        src/generic/problemresolver/model.tex (although not all my
        notes have migrated into the LaTeX source yet; this will be
        fixed in the future).

  * Implemented my proposed description formatting extensions of
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg02770.html --
    aptitude now detects and appropriately formats most bulleted
    lists in package descriptions.

  * From the confirmation prompt (and now the resolver prompt) of the
    command-line mode, you can now additionally keep packages back
    (without setting a hold), mark packages as automatic or manual,
    and simultaneously install a package and mark it as manual.

  * ~ahold now matches only packages that have a "sticky" hold set.
    ~akeep will find packages upon which no action is being taken.  To
    get the old behavior of ~ahold, use ~U~akeep.  (Closes: #216730)

  * A brief summary of the currently-open views now appears at the top
    of the screen when multiple views are open.

  * Merged command-line support for apt-secure from 0.2.15.9.

- Bugfixes:

  * Don't discard messages about how to resolve a problem with loading
    the cache file.  In particular, the dialog box that you get if
    dpkg was interrupted should make a lot more sense.
    (Closes: #160418)

  * Actually process the message about failed downloads using fragf.
    (Closes: #298713)

  * Fix the "help crashes" bug.  (Closes: #293935, plus all the other
    bugs reported by people who don't check the BTS first)

  * Hard-wrap, don't clip, long literally formatted lines (in
    accordance with Policy).

  * Text in a number of places is now automatically formatted instead
    of having hard-wired line wrapping.

  * Fixed the formatting and size calculation of fragments even in the
    presence of indentation.

  * Made the description widget (and other similar widgets) actually
    cache its formatting, rather than recalculating it every time the
    screen is redrawn.

  * Centralized the detection of the terminal width when running in
    command-line mode; previously, some commands would properly wrap
    text, but others wouldn't.

  * Don't abort, just print a warning if the user passes -s in
    interactive mode.  (Closes: #243192)

  * Fixed an ugly problem with the docbook documentation -- instead of
    using the DTD on the user's system, it was loading it off the net
    (merged from the stable branch).

  * Correct the documentation of Delete-Unused (merged from stable).

[1/10/2005]           "Ow, my thesis!
                       That's funny, it didn't hurt that time..."

- Bugfixes:

  * (sort of) fixed a bug which caused aptitude to want to remove
    stuff installed with another package manager.  In order to trigger
    this, you would have to remove the package with aptitude, quit
    aptitude without installing or removing anything else, then
    install the package in the other package manager before running
    aptitude again.

    The caveat on the fix is that if you ^C aptitude between removing
    the package and reloading the cache, you can still get bitten.  A
    more proper fix may be included in a future aptitude version.

- New features:

  * By default, aptitude will only pause after a download if errors
    occured.  Both of the old settings (always/never pause) are still
    available.

  * "autoclean" will tell you how much stuff it cleaned up.  For
    technical reasons, "clean" cannot easily produce the same
    information.

- Internal changes:

  * Ported aptitude to libsigc++ 2.0.

  * Various bits of text are now displayed as fragments instead of
    labels, so they get properly word-wrapped and so on.  This work is
    ongoing and has revealed some structural weaknesses in fragments
    that need to be fixed before entrenching them too much.

[12/21/2004]
Version 0.3.0         "Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"

  This is the first release of a new development branch, forked from 0.2.15.8.

- Bugfixes:

  * The buttons in the search dialog are properly centered.

  * Internal errors that are generated because of bad formatting
    characters are less cryptic.

- New features:

  * Support for apt 0.6's security features: aptitude will flag
    packages that are untrusted, and will warn you if you try to
    install an untrusted package or upgrade from a trusted to an
    untrusted version.  The warnings are currently quite obtrusive and
    strongly worded, and cannot be turned off.

- Internal changes:

  * Completely redesigned widget layout to better accomodate widgets
    whose width and height are interrelated.  The new system
    completely allocates widths before allocating heights, allowing
    stuff like word-wrapped text to be handled sanely.

- Translation updates:

  * Arabic [NEW]

  * Basque (Closes: #275704)

  * Brazilian Portuguese (Closes: #275220)

  * Turkish (Closes: #280009)

[3/26/2004]
Version 0.2.15.9      "I see you see we all see C see sea"
- Bugfixes:
  * Correct the English documentation of Aptitude::Delete-Unused;
    its description of this option's behavior was exactly the
    reverse of what actually happens!

  * Fix a trivial typo that caused an unsightly disfigurement
    of the Search dialog.

- Backports from aptitude 0.3.x:
  * aptitude now compiles cleanly against APT 0.6, with full support
    for package trust.

- Translation updates:

  * Arabic

  * Basque (Closes: #275704)

  * Chinese, Simplified

  * Chinese, Traditional (Closes: #274268, #290284)

  * Czech

  * Spanish

[9/28/2004]
Version 0.2.15.8      "UTF-what?"
- Bugfixes:
  * Patch from Konstantinos Margaritis to "fix" the UTF-8 problem with
    a sledgehammer: if aptitude sees UTF-8 in the locale, it will
    set the locale to C instead.

  * Under "Suggested packages", only show packages that something suggests.
    (previously, other relationships -- such as Replaces or Conflicts --
     were causing stuff to end up there).  (Closes: #270667)

  * Belatedly apply a very old patch to improve saving Minesweeper games
    and to add some sanity-checks to Minesweeper.  (Closes: #179533)

- Translation updates:

  * French (Closes: #272824)

  * Italian (Closes: #265243)

  * Japanese (Closes: #272454)

  * Russian

[9/17/2004]
Version 0.2.15.7      "Kerplop"
- Bugfixes:
  * Use the candidate version to look for stuff to install; this makes
    installation via patterns work better.

  * Parse priority strings up-front, and accept either an English string
    or the string in the current locale.

  * Fixed a segfault that occured if the %r escape was used.

  * Fix several potential (unreported, perhaps un-triggerable) segfaults
    in the table code.

  * Various documentation fixes (Closes: #269102, #269100).

- Translation updates:

  * Brazilian (Closes: #271411)

  * Catalan (Closes: #270917)

  * Finnish (Closes: #263313)

  * Norwegian (Closes: #269976)

  * Russian (Closes: #266294)

  * Spanish (Closes: #269311)

[8/6/2004]
Version 0.2.15.6      "Brrrrrrr"
- Bugfixes:
  * When displaying the size change in a single version, use '+'
    for increases and '-' for decreases rather than the other
    way around.

  * "make install" installs localized manpages in $mandir now (thanks
    to Sebastian Kapfer for pointing out that this wasn't happening)

- Translation updates:
  * Czech (Debian bug #262524)

  * Danish (Debian bug #262129)

  * Dutch (Debian bug #262000)

  * Finnish (Debian bug #263313)

  * Portuguese (Debian bug #261502)

[7/25/2004]
Version 0.2.15.5      "Is it just me, or is it freezing in here?"
- New features and bugfixes:

  - 'aptitude moo' no longer insults the user, even under extreme provocation.

  - It is now possible to log to multiple destinations. (Debian bug #259714)

  - A format code (%i) has been added to display policy information about
    package versions (ie, the priority to which they are pinned).
    (Debian bug #240423)

  - An option has been added which disables some of the sanity checks
    performed prior to installing packages: the program will proceed
    to the preview screen if any packages are upgradable, even if they
    aren't being upgraded. (Debian bug #260590)

  - Undoing "forget new" works again.

  - Scrolling in pagers scrolls by the correct amount now. (Debian bug #260713)

  - You can once again enter an empty limit string to reset the limit.
    (Debian bug #260244)

  - Changed (completely useless at the moment) creation of a pthreads
    mutex to compile on FreeBSD.

- Translation updates:

  - Brazilian (Debian bug #260953)

  - Catalan (Debian bug #261095)

  - Czech (Debian bug #259966)

  - Dutch (Debian bug #260632)

  - Italian (Debian bug #261017)

  - Greek (Debian bug #261029)

  - Portuguese (Debian bug #261425)

[7/15/2004]
Version 0.2.15.4      "Flying Space Cucumber"
- New features:

  * Recommended (but not installed) packages are shown in both previews
    now.

  * Suggests-Important is back as a synonym for Keep-Suggests.  This
    should smooth out the transition for people who were using it.
    (Debian bug #259387)

  * Changelogs can be viewed from the command-line.

  * When downloading a package from the command-line, you can select
    the version to be downloaded. (Debian bug #160145)

  * Added a menu/keyboard command to search for the next broken package.
    (Debian bug #162474)

  * Extended the package menu with options to manipulate a package's
    automatic flag, view its information, or view its changelog.

  * Dependency patterns can now match on any dependency field; see the
    documentation for details.

- Bugfixes:

  * Several potential and actual memory leaks in the command-line code
    were fixed.

  * The command-line mode now complains loudly in some places where it
    used to fail silently.

[7/13/2004]
Version 0.2.15.3      "Release Roulette"
- New features:

  * When displaying aptitude's explanations about dependency
    situations, packages that are unavailable will be marked as such.

  * Some messages from the command-line mode (eg, about packages that
    are already installed/removed) are now suppressed unless you pass
    -v on the command-line.

- Bugfixes:

  * Document the Yes/No commands.

  * Return the newest version available from visible_version(), which
    should make changelog viewing and a few other things work in a
    less obscure fashion.

  * Correctly initialize the menu autohide setting (Debian bug #258688).

  * Suppress self-conflicts more vigorously (Debian bug #258533).

  * Fixed a number of bugs related to undos; they should work much better
    now (in particular, undoing an upgrade command will work reliably).

  * The tracking of automatic packages is somewhat smarter about
    versions: if upgrading a package causes it to become unused, it
    will be held back; if a package is being removed because it is
    unused and something depending on its current version is
    installed, the package will be held even if it could be
    upgraded. (say that five times fast!)

    Basically, aptitude won't randomly remove packages that you try to
    upgrade because they're suddenly "unused"; instead, it will refuse
    to upgrade them.

- Translation/i18n updates:

  * Miroslav Kure heroically translated the entire DocBook manual into
    Czech, along with general updates to the Czech translation.

  * The keybindings for Yes and No are now translatable (Debian bug #258409).

  * Split the English manpage into a separate XML file (Debian bug #259089).

  * Brazilian translation update (Debian bug #258667).

  * Greek translation update (Debian bug #258805).

  * French translation update.

  * Spanish translation update from Rubes Porras (Debian bug #258243).

[7/7/2004]
Version 0.2.15.2      "Configure this!"
- New features:

  * Added a configuration option Aptitude::Keep-Suggests.  This will
    cause automatically installed packages to stay on the system if
    any installed package even Suggests them.

  * Added a command-line argument -o; this behaves in the same way as
    the apt-get -o command-line argument.

- Bugfixes:

  * Fixed a very old bug in configuration handling.  This version of
    aptitude will only save configuration options that you have
    modified in your personal file.  (this includes options that you
    changed and re-set to their default values) This means that future
    changes in aptitude's default settings will be picked up by most
    people; right now you will only see changes to the defaults if
    you've never used an Options dialog.  You may want to revert your
    options to the defaults to take advantage of this feature.

     (Debian bug #175409)

  * Fixed the manpage synopsis: it said forbid-upgrade instead of
    forbid-version. (Debian bug #257901)

  * Removed an accent that accidentally crept into an image filename
    in the documentation.

  * In the Vertical-Split theme, version numbers are hidden by default
    (there isn't room for them on a standard terminal)

- Translation updates:

  * Updated Finish translations (Debian bug #257902)

  * Updated Italian translations (Debian bug #257710)

[7/4/2004]
Version 0.2.15.1      "Obligatory July 4th reference"
- Bugfixes:

  * Fix a segfault that occured in certain (undetermined) circumstances:
    a codepath that never ran on my computer would inevitably dereference
    NULL.

  * Include all the screen-shot images.

[7/1/2004]
Version 0.2.15        "Daniel's Adventures in the Land of DocBook"

- New features:

  * aptitude now has a "proper" manual, or at least the first iteration
    of one.  It weighs in at ~7000 lines of DocBook (which is less
    impressive than it sounds, since most lines of DocBook are fluff)
    and generates HTML pages, text documentation, and a manpage from
    a single source.

  * You can now keep a package at its current version without setting a
    sticky hold by pressing ':'.

  * A new %-escape for the display format, %Z, has been added.  It
    displays the change in disk usage due to an individual package (or
    version); the default package format uses it.

  * Several new menus added: you can now change a package's state or
    search for a package from the menu.

  * A convenient keybinding for reporting a bug has been added.

  * Matchers for reverse dependencies are now much more powerful;
    matchers for reverse and forward provides are available.

  * Passing -v to an installation command will display packages that are
    suggested and won't be installed.

  * You can now retrieve information about a package from the command-line
    mode's prompt.

  * "aptitude show" will display a package's Essential flag.

  * The new "--visual-preview" command-line option uses the visual mode
    to handle previews and downloads for command-line actions.
    (Debian bug #253335)

  * aptitude should now display translated task descriptions; thanks
    to Denis Barbier.
    (Debian bug #203725)

- Bugfixes:

  * aptitude now handles limits that match no packages more gracefully.

  * All traces of Suggests-Important were removed. (Debian bug #245410)

  * aptitude should compile with g++ 3.4 now.

  * aptitude now looks for unused packages on startup, so the old behavior
    (where some package states would be illogical and "snap" to the correct
    values as soon as you did anything) no longer occurs.

  * Handling of automatic/manual packages was tweaked in a few other
    ways; handling of automatically changed packages was also tweaked.

  * Completely disabled the use of the severely broken non-hierarchical
    view; the categorical browser just uses a hierarchical display now.
    (Debian bugs #120978, #144079, #144083, #151437, #242397)

  * Undoing the "forbid upgrade" command should work in all cases now.

  * Removed trailing periods from all menu item descriptions.
    (Debian bug #244676)

  * Fixed compilation on all 5 existing ia64 systems (Debian bug #243932).

  * If the user tries to remove an essential package but then cancels
    the removal, aptitude no longer displays an ominous warning about
    removing essential packages.  (Debian bug #254422)

  * Fixed the display of ORed dependencies in "aptitude show".
    (Debian bug #254740)

  * Menus are now sized more intelligently; text within menus is laid
    out slightly better.

  * When a very narrow terminal is being used, menus should be displayed
    a bit more gracefully.

  * Fixed some bugs with rebinding keys.

  * Removed references to some obsolete (unused) keybindings and colors.

  * There is now a space between the current and candidate versions in
    the default display format.

  * Widget alignment within a row is now written as "top" and
    "bottom", not "left" and "right".

  * Reverting options affects the user's configuration file
    immediately.

  * "aptitude show" no longer performs a search unless the input
    contains a tilde.

  * Fixed the display of ORed dependencies when describing reasons
    for a package's state. (Debian bug #242663)

  * Improved the calculation of reasons for a package's state in the
    presence of virtual packages. (Debian bug #244817)

- Translations:

  * Basque updates (Debian bug #244858)

[4/03/2004]
Version 0.2.14.1      "Spit and polish"

Thanks to Christian Perrier <bubulle@debian.org> for helping to triage
the large pile of new and updated translations that appeared in this
release.

- Bugfixes and new features:

  * You can now forbid aptitude to automatically select a particular
    package version in an upgrade.  This is mainly meant to make
    situations where a known-bad package is in unstable easier to handle.
    This functionality can be accessed via "F" in visual mode, or via
    the "forbid-version" command-line action.

  * Several more improvements to how autoinstalled packages are
    handled.  In particular, you no longer have to chase the whole
    dependency tree if you de-select and then re-select a package with
    many autoinstalled dependencies.

  * Save whether packages are currently going to be upgraded in the
    state file (separately from whether the package should be
    installed at all).

  * If the preview screen will be empty, an explanatory dialog is
    displayed instead of a blank screen.  If it looks like the user
    just forgot to press "U", suggest that.

  * Added a "reinstall" command-line action. (Debian bug #240225)

  * Added a "%t" formatting escape which displays the Archive of a package.
    In addition, "aptitude show" with verbosity>1 will display Archive
    information. (Debian bug #113354)

  * aptitude now supports the Key attribute of tasks (Debian bug #202781)

  * Fixed fetching ChangeLogs for classes with epoched versions and
    for non-free/contrib packages.  (Debian bugs #237340, #233855)

  * Manpage proofreading and polishing from Danilo Piazzalunga.
    The reference to apt-get(8) has been corrected, and -t is documented.
    (Debian bugs #198891, #225053)

  * Fixed the names of download views in the View menu.
    (Debian bug #234041)

  * Use fragment-based layout instead of a vs_pager to display error
    messages.  This means that they will wrap to the terminal
    width. (Debian bug #233923)

  * In the dependency ("d") and version ("v") lists, the description
    of the selected package is now visible by default.

  * Added section descriptions for the new archive sections.
    (Debian bug #233913)

  * Information on Provides is now included in the package information
    display and in "aptitude show".  (Debian bug #121979)

  * Upgrades from security.debian.org should go in a separate
    top-level tree.  (note: this is untested!)  Also, re-ordered the
    toplevel trees.

  * Avoid destroying all visible widgets without quitting in some corner
    cases. (Debian bug #233783)

  * Removed some text that was being ignored anyway from the
    definition of the "miscellaneous" options dialog.  I would have
    left it alone, but I think it could theoretically cause a problem.
    (Debian bug #233528)

- Translation updates:

  * Brazilian Portuguese program translation update.
    (Debian bugs #237866, #199306)
  * Czech translation update. (Debian bug #240604)
  * Danish program translation update. (Debian bugs #230642, #234805)
  * Finnish program translation update. (Debian bug #238188)
  * French program translation update. (Debian bug #237501)
  * German program translation update. (Debian bug #233917)
  * Italian translation update. (Debian bug #239915)
  * Japanese program translation update. (Debian bug #235256)
  * Japanese translation update. (Debian bug #239242)
  * Lituanian translation update. (Debian bug #240683)
  * Norwegian Nynorsk translation update. (Debian bug #241104)
  * Partial Greek program translation added. (Debian bug #237808)
  * Partial Traditional Chinese program translation update. (Debian bug #230893)
  * Portuguese program translation. (Debian bug #239171)
  * Simplified Chinese translation update. (Debian bug #240739)
  * Spanish program translation update. (Debian bug #234537)


[2/15/2004]
Version 0.2.14        "I say a package, and you say ah pahckahge"

- Bugfixes and new features:

  * Several command-line actions no longer crash when sources.list is
    missing or unreadable.  In addition, if sources.list is present but
    unreadable, the visual frontend no longer crashes. (Debian bug #220732)

  * Fixed the detection of packages broken by conflicts.

- Build system and internal changes:

  * Use AS_HELP_STRING to format help output from configure.

- Translation updates

  * Italian updates (including a manpage translation) from Danilo Piazzalunga.

  * Fixed the translation of a format string in the Czech translation, which
    was causing segfaults.

[2/13/2004]
Version 0.2.13.9999.3 "Sisyphus Boulder Transportation and
                       Delivery Engineers, Incorporated[tm]"

- Bugfixes and new features:

  * In the information area for packages, a note about disk usage
    is printed (eg, "This package will be upgraded for <v1> to <v2>,
    using 1111kB of additional disk space.")  Useful for sending
    bug reports to maintainers who accidentally upload unstripped
    binaries of their latest package version.

  * (undocumented) Experimental support for "filling" some text to the
    screen width; set Aptitude::UI::Fill-Text to True to use this.

  * An FAQ is now shipped with aptitude.  I could only think of two
    questions, but I expect that more will be asked over time.

- Build system and internal changes:

  * aptitude can now be compiled with g++ 3.0.  g++ 2.95 is not
    supported due to at least one nasty bug in its STL which prevents
    aptitude from compiling.  However, compiling with g++ 3.0 is enough
    to get a woody backport.

- Translation updates:

  * Further Italian updates from Danilo Piazzalunga.

  * Spanish translation updates from Ruben Porras.

[2/8/2004]
Version 0.2.13.9999.2 "Polar Eclipse"

- Bugfixes and new features:

  * Further enhancements to the new information display.  It now shows
    any packages that are broken "because of" the currently selected
    package.  In addition, the information is colorized (if the
    terminal supports it) to give a better idea of why dependencies
    are broken.

  * The information area will automatically switch to showing
    dependency information when a package breaks (press 'i' to switch
    back).

  * Fixed the changelog fetching code. (Debian bugs #103455, #208041)

  * aptitude no longer automatically holds packages in any
    circumstance; packages can be automatically kept back, but this
    doesn't persist the way hold does.  (Debian bug #149161)

  * Added support for a "show" action on the command-line.

  * Invalid patterns no longer crash the search function.
    (Debian bug #214245)

  * Downgrades are now written to the log.  (Debian bug #222583)
    Patch from Danilo Piazzalunga.

  * Scrollbars are now clickable.

  * Many minor changes not mentioned here; see ChangeLog for the gory
    details.

- Internal changes:

  * Removed the HAVE_LIBAPT_PKG3 macro: this was intended to support
    compiling against old apt versions, but those versions are now
    ancient, and the program doesn't compile against them anyway.
    Even if you wanted to, aptitude relies on having a newer version
    of g++, while older apt versions won't even compile on modern g++
    versiosn.

- Translation-related changes:

  * zh_CN translation of help.txt added (also from Carlos).

  * pt_BR translation updated (Andre Luis Lopes).
  

[2/3/2004]
Version 0.2.13.9999 "It goes ZIP when it moves!"

- Bugfixes and new features:

  * Don't abort loading the cache if apt generates warnings, such as
    the warning that a new source is available.  This means that
    aptitude doesn't behave pathologically when you add a new line to
    sources.list.  (Debian bug #143732)

  * Holding a package back or clearing a package's hold flag no longer
    affect the auto-install flag.  (Debian bug #159582)

  * Expanded the "reason" information that can be shown about
    packages, and hooked it into the visual interface (the preview
    display will show this information automatically)

  * In previews, include a list of packages which are not installed
    but are suggested by packages that are being installed.

  * Entering the Preferences dialog for the first time no longer
    causes Suggested packages to be automatically installed.

  * Fix the way that options set via the dialogs are saved.
    (Debian bug #216268)

  * Added a scrollbar for the package description.

  * Added padding between the labels of options and their settings (in the
  * preference dialogs)

  * Removed the idempotency option from the dialogs.

  * Removed ~e: it was broken, inelegant, and superceded by regexps.
    (Debian bug #196447)

  * Additional minor bugfixes and editorial changes.

- Build system and internal changes:

  * Now uses autoconf2.5.

  * Added a flexible system for formatting text (see fragment.cc).
    This system is now used to handle package descriptions, as well as
    a few other things.  This is a very promising addition to
    aptitude's UI toolkit, and will almost certainly be used for
    additional features in the future.  (for instance, it's about
    80-90% of the way to being able to display simple hypertext)

- Translation-related changes:

  * Missing i18n markings added to many strings.
    (Debian bug #230060)

  * Fixed the German translation of "limit" (Debian bug #214021)

  * Added a pt_BR translation, thanks to Gustavo Silva.
    (Debian bug #214116)

  * Added an Italian translation, thanks to Danilo Piazzalunga.

  * Updates to da.po from Morten Bo Johansen.

  * Added a Czech translation, thanks to Miroslav Kure.

[6/9/2003]
Version 0.2.13 "Pop goes the weasel"

  * Fixes a number of crashes due to mishandling of memory, spotted
    by Peter Lundkvist and Sami Liedes.
    (Debian bug #192073 and #109420)

  * Fix some crashes after updates, diagnosis by Peter Lundkvist.
    (Debian bug #109420)

  * No longer occasionally uses the first letter of the description as
    a flag character, diagnosis by Seneca Cunningham. (Debian bug #183462)

  * Translation updates to pt_BR by Andre Luis Lopes (Debian bug #195755)

  * Ported to libsigc++-1.2.  Hopefully everything should work fine,
    but I can't guarantee that no problems remain.

  * Added an option to disable -Werror, needed until Debian's ncurses
    implementation is fixed.

[2/10/2003]
Version 0.2.12 "O Ye of Little Faith!"
  * Compiles with g++-3.2.  (Debian bugs #166435, 177092, 177463, 178520, and
    maybe others)

  * Match strings can be POSIX regular expressions.  (note that
    regular expression metacharacters which also have a special
    meaning for aptitude, such as "(", ")", and "!", must be tilde-escaped)
    (Debian bug #142450)

  * You can now see how much each package's installed size changed by
    by specifying -Z on the command-line.  (only works for command-line
    upgrades so far)

  * You can search for text in the internal pagers.  (Debian bug #144085)

  * Fixes to formatting code (Debian bug #163749)

  * When searching for packages from the command-line, you can now
    specify the order in which to sort results.

  * If no version of any package could possibly fulfill a dependency,
    it is textually flagged as "UNAVAILABLE".  (Debian bug #157950)

  * The quick-help bar now indicates that "g" will also remove packages.
    (Debian bug #158966)

  * Disable saving/loading of packages' reinstall state, it's too annoying.
    (Debian bugs #167236, #121346)

  * Bold colors can be specified in the config file (although they will
    cause problems in some contexts).  (Debian bug #168287)

  * "Minor" fix to the package gc: when marking packages, follow
    pre-depends.  This fixes the bug which prevented installation of
    the new dpkg (this fix was previously introduced as a Debian revision,
    and closed bug #151701)

  * Startup should be faster in certain circumstances (eg: when many new
    packages are available, or many packages have changed state)

  * "aptitude install <task-name>" will install all packages in the task.
    (Debian bug #165624)

  * The resize bug in curses is fixed; re-enabled asynchronous resizing.

  * Equivalent to apt-get's "-t" command-line argument.
    (Debian bug #151583)  NOTE: this is untested, since I don't have a
    machine where it would have any interesting effect, but I'm setting the
    same APT option as apt-get, so it should work.  The effects on
    the interactive mode of the program are unknown at this time, use
    with caution!

  * Translation updates to:
   - da.po by Morten Bo Johansen <mojo@image.dk> (Debian bug #171903)
   - pt_BR.po by Andre Luis Lopes <andrelop@ig.com.br> (Debian bug #162512)

   In addition, changed the content-type of fr.po (Debian bug #156616)

  * The information in the log file about how much the size changed by
    should be much more legible now.  (Debian bug #154924)

  * Fixed an integer overflow when downloading really humongous packages.
    (Debian bug #171903)

  * Documented "M" and "m" in the online help (Debian bugs #160936, #154000)

  * Expunged all references to the "x" keybinding. (Debian bug #166571)

  * Several minor fixes of bugs, memory leaks, etc.

[4/21/2002]
Version 0.2.11.1 "Data updates are my friend"
  * This release has corrections to typos and other data issues; it does
    not change a single line of code.  This should be pushed into woody.

  * Merged updated Polish translations from Michal Politowski
   <mpol@charybda.icm.edu.pl>  (Debian bug #143051)

  * Merged updated Finnish translations from Jaakko Kangasharju <ashar@iki.fi>

  * Included information on the CVS tree (Debian bug #141371)

  * Fixed the dangling reference to SEARCHING in the manpage
  (Debian bug #142651)

[4/06/2002]
Version 0.2.11 "Look Ma, No Hands!"
           aka "Hello, JoeyH :)"

  * IMPORTANT: The "new" command style is now default.  The old one is
  available from the options menu, and users of previous versions may have
  it in ~/.aptitude/config.  The new style is fairly straightforward,
  and similar to dselect.  (eg: '+' tells the program to install the package
  at the most recent version, and/or cancels holds)
    With any luck, this will squeeze into woody; I don't need a whole new
  generation of users used to the old imprecise system before I change it.

  * '+' on an installed package no longer reinstalls it.  A separate
  keybinding for reinstalling packages is now available, defaulting to 'L'.
  (Debian bug #183122)

  * The prompt in command-line mode now allows you to enter the full UI,
  or to modify the set of installed/removed/purged packages.
  (Debian bug #136916)

  * The preview in command-line mode can be more informative: it can display
  version numbers and dependency information.  (-V and -D)

  * Added a -P option; passing it causes aptitude to always prompt for
  confirmation.

  * Verbosity levels are now available.  Right now this only affects
  simulation (with verbosity=0, the long list of "Inst foo/Conf foo/etc"
  is suppressed)

  * Many command-line options can now be given in the configuration file.
  (eg, Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Versions for -V)

  * The command-line mode now supports an "unhold" command.
  (Debian bug #137770)

  * Tasks and sections now have "descriptions" which appear in the
  `package description area'.  (Debian bug #136684)

  * Added a %H display escape, which expands to the hostname of the
  computer aptitude is running on.  (Debian bug #137754)

  * In command-line mode, the prompt is suppressed on upgrades when nothing
  is to be done. (Debian bug #137302)

  * Reinstalled packages are displayed in the preview screens again.
  (Debian bug #138120)

  * Rewrote the description widget's formatting code to be reasonably
  legible; this had the side effect of fixing an otherwise tricky bug.
  (Debian bug #137783)

  * Fixed a bug which made the Tasks tree virtually useless by hiding
  many packages. (Debian bug #136684)

  * If the user aborts an update, reload the cache.  (Debian bug #138070)

  * autoclean now defaults to false, the "safe" option.  (Debian bug #138685)

  * Fixed a nasty segfault involving running off the end of the list.
  (Debian bug #136967)

  * Fixed an infinite loop if the user tried to scroll the description while
  it was hidden. (Debian bug #140361)

  * The "install" command-line action doesn't interpret trailing plus
  characters (or hyphens, underscores, or equal signs) in a package name
  as explicit install requests if a package by that name already exists.
    In short: "aptitude install g++" actually works.  (Debian bug #140933)

  * Focus handling: you can no longer focus an empty description widget, and
  the highlight bar in the package tree is hidden when the tree loses focus.
  (Debian bug #136550)

  * "aptitude --help" now documents the "download" command.
  (Debian bug #138150)

  * The status messages on startup are now suppressed in the "aptitude search"
  command. (Debian bug #136873)

  * When the download is stalled, "stalled" is now displayed in the progress
  bar.  (Debian bug #136520)

  * The command-line mode deals sanely with window resizes.
  (Debian bug #137945)

  * For obsolete and local packages, an "available" version is not displayed.
  (Debian bug #120872)

  * Added a description for the "alien" section (Debian bug #136684)

  * aptitude now recognizes "--version" (Debian bug #141296)

  * German translation updated, courtesy of Erich Schubert <erich@debian.org>

  * Thanks go to joeyh (and others) for sending in a slew of bug reports
  and suggestions.

[3/02/2002]
Version 0.2.10 "World Domination Or Bust"
  * aptitude now has support for batch/command-line mode, similar to apt-get.
    This isn't going to make everyone happy just yet, but it should cover
  most common cases.  Upgrades via this approach get all the usual benefits
  of aptitude (tracking unused packages, recommends, etc).   There are
  various other features; see aptitude(1).

  * If a package matches the "never remove these packages" expression,
  not only will it not be removed automatically, but its dependencies
  are also protected.

  * Documented the "p" state of packages.  (Debian bug #135112)

  * Matchers now exist for upgradable and new packages.  The new meaning
  of the ~r matcher (things which would be removed due to being unused)
  has been assigned to the new ~g matcher; the old ~r meaning has been
  reinstated.  (Debian bug #135571)

  * If Suggested packages are being installed by default, no packages
  will be removed automatically if something else Suggests them.  There
  are still a few odd cases here, but this is probably about as
  good as I can do for now.  (Debian bug #135956)

  * There is now a menu item to mark all upgradable and not manually held
  packages for upgrade.

  * Packages being downgraded are now split into their own section in the
  preview.

  * Logging is now on by default; /var/log/aptitude is used.

  * When Auto-Upgrade is off, packages which are not manually held are
  not displayed with "h" in the action field.

  * Updated Finnish translations from Jaakko Kangasharju <ashar@iki.fi>

  * Fixed a display problem in the download screen; the amount of time
  displayed in the summary always had an extra "s" appended to it.
  (Debian bug #135567)

  * Removed the INSTALLATION section from the manual; however, it
  was replaced by command line options.  I'm not sure how joeyh
  will feel about this fix.  (Debian bug #136478)

[2/17/2002]
Version 0.2.9.4 "Black Holes Are Where God Divided By Zero"
  * When calculating the time remaining in a download, aptitude
  was dividing by CurrentCPS.  Unfortunately, CurrentCPS is often
  zero!  On some platforms this works anyway, but it crashes on others
  (eg, alpha)

   The code now tests whether CurrentCPS is zero when generating the
  progress bar. (Debian bug #122064)

  * Forget-new-on-update actually works. (Debian bug #134226)

[2/10/2002]
Version 0.2.9.3 "Curse you, gcc steering committe!"
  * g++-3 #defines _GNU_SOURCE by default, causing compilation to
  die in because it's already defined.  All #define _GNU_SOURCE
  directives are now protected.  (Debian bug #133250)

  * Actually include the Polish translation of the manpage, and update
  pl.po slightly.
  (Debian bug #114396)

[2/09/2002]
Version 0.2.9.2 "Odds 'n Ends"
  * This release is because I accidentally left some uncommitted cruft on
  a computer I wasn't planning to use for a while.  I rediscovered it,
  equally accidentally, and am now releasing it officially.

  * Added %M to the default column display.

  * Tweaked the preview screen so that packages which are being automatically
  upgraded do not appear as being "Automatically Installed" (maybe not the best
  way of doing things?)

  * Really fixed the su-to-root stuff.

  * ~ahold now really does the Right Thing (same for some related stuff)
  (Debian bug #126800)

[2/09/2002]
Version 0.2.9.1 "Silence of the LANs"
  * Argh.  I left a bug in 0.2.9; marking a package as auto-installed screwed
  up undo.  Fixed now.

[2/09/2002]
Version 0.2.9 "Please Sir, Can I Have Some More?" aka
              "When Changelog Entries Attack" aka
              "Slower Than Cold Molasses"
  * This one took so long to get out and has so many bugfixes that it
   gets three release names.  Aren't you happy? :)

  * aptitude now has functionality similar to debfoster/deborphan.
  It tracks whether a package was automatically installed and
  automatically marks automatically installed, but not-depended-upon,
  packages for removal.  You can of course adjust this behavior; see
  the "TRACKING UNUSED PACKAGES" section of the manual.
    (Debian bugs #122726, #102205, #114464)

  * Added logic for idempotent package commands, and an option to enable
  them.  I feel that these commands are actually much more logical than
  the old-style aptitude commands.

  * Packages which are held, but broken, are now visually flagged as being
  broken.  (Debian bug #120785)

  * The log messages now include date/time.  (Debian bug #120874)

  * Re-ordered the preview screen's grouping.  I would like feedback
  on this.  (Debian bug #128542)

  * Rewrote several sections of the documentation, partly based on user
  input.  (Debian bug #126492)

  * Mark all upgradable packages for upgrade before resolving any
  dependencies.  This handles a situation involving ORed version-specific
  dependencies.  (Debian bug #108379)

  * Changed the symbols for collapsed/opened trees to something not
  using +/-, which seem to be ambiguous.  (Debian bugs #120890, 102033)

  * When editing a string, the cursor now starts at the beginning of the
  line.  (Debian bug #120890)

  * When reconfiguring packages, gracefully handle the case where
  /usr/sbin/su-to-root does not exist.  (Debian bug #130423)

  * Really made translated header widths work (and I tested it this time! :) )
  (Debian bug #114401)

  * Corrected a misspelling in the options dialog (Debian bug #120887)

  * Updates to da.po from Morten Brix Pederson <morten@wtf.dk>

  * The information bar at the top of the screen is now translatable.
  Patch from Morten Brix Pederson.

  * Fixed a misspelling in de.po.  (Debian bug #123644)

  * Fixed a minor display bug when a package category was longer than the
  width of the screen and the last item in the display.  (Debian bug #123652)

[12/09/2001]
Version 0.2.8.1 "Sigh"
  * Incremental search now returns the display to the starting location on
  the empty string and invalid patterns.

  * There is now a matcher for packages which are not depended on in various
  ways.  (Debian bug #122726)

  * The pause after a download is now optional (Debian bug #120873)

  * package data moved to /var/lib by default.  (Debian bug #122334)

  * Aptitude should not crash on alpha any more, at least, not the way
  it used to.

  * Description of the "comm" section changed to explicitly include
  non-faxmodems. (Debian bug #121951)

  * "j" and "k" were reversed in the help text.  They are now correct.
  (Debian bug #122061)

  * Danish translation from Morten Brix Pedersen <morten@wtf.dk>

  * es_ES.po has been renamed to es.po.  Someone who knows more about
  Spanish than me (Jordi Malloch) told me this was a better name for it.

  * pt_BR.po updated from patch supplied by
  Andre Luis Lopes <andrelop@ig.com.br>  (Debian bug #122251)

[11/22/2001]
Version 0.2.8 "I Like Bunnies"
  * Better documentation for the behavior of "/" when no special search
  terms are used.  (Debian bug #120592)

  * Fixes some segfaults accidentally introduced with the incsearch code.

  * Incremental search is now an option (defaulting to ON)

  * Added special matchers which match packages depending on another
  package.  These matchers take another matcher as an argument, so
  you can specify conditions such as "packages depending on packages
  maintained by me"

[11/21/2001]
Version 0.2.7.999 "This release will self-destruct in 10 seconds"
  * This release is a prerelease to 0.2.8, to test the new incsearch code.

  * Incremental search implemented, finally.

  * Don't crash if tasksel is missing.  (Debian bug #120578)

  * Make sure to use the correct translated column widths all the time.
    (Debian bug #114401)

  * Minor memory leak in search code fixed (it would leak a few bytes
  every time you entered a new search term)

[11/20/2001]
Version 0.2.7.3 "Boy I'm glad I'm not a turkey"
  * Categories updated to take into account many new packages in the
  archive.

  * New pl translation finally merged.  (Debian bug #114396)

  * Fixed reference to ~a/~A in README (Debian bug #116695)

[11/20/2001]
Version 0.2.7.2 "Ludicrous Speed"
  * Rewrote the task loader based on input from Jason Gunthorpe.
    The new version should be significantly faster, especially on
  low-end systems.  (Debian bug #116750)

  * Fixed an annoying visual bug involving the page-up key.

  * Added a menu item to reload the cache on demand (useful for debugging)
    This is a compile-time option and defaults to being disabled.

  * The "f" key in Minesweeper mode is now documented in the online help.
    (Debian bug #120251)

[10/01/2001]
Version 0.2.7.1 "Millenium Hand and Shrimp"
  * Made it compile again using g++-3.

[10/01/2001]
Version 0.2.7 "All the zeros and ones"
  * Version number bumped, just because this is not merely a trivial bugfix,
  and the version numbers were getting silly.

  * Added support for the Task header.  (Debian bug #113657)
    I'm not sure what will happen if you have task- packages as well as
    Task headers.  Probably something weird.

[9/22/2001]
Version 0.2.6.5 "Twisting arms"
  * Work around a g++ bug on arm by reversing the order of some #includes.

  * Reverting options no longer sets options which had been set by the user's
  personal configuration to a blank string.

[9/15/2001]
Version 0.2.6.4 "If at first you don't succeed"
  * Loading keybindings works again.  In addition, it works correctly
  in the presence of themes.  (the keybindings defined in the theme can
  be individually overridden by the user)  Fixes Debian bug #112307

  * The list of available keybindings in README has been corrected.

[9/14/2001]
Version 0.2.6.3 "More bug-skooshing"
  * When compiled without optimization, aptitude no longer crashes whenever
  a package is unhighlighted.  (I shudder to think why the optimized build
  wasn't crashing)

  * move_forward_level no longer ever "falls off the edge of the world".
  This fixes the segfault reported in #112267.

[9/13/2001]
Version 0.2.6.2 "Bug-skooshing"
  * The program no longer crashes when the hierarchy editor is used.
  All known something-completely-doesn't-work type bugs are now fixed.

  * Updated the package categorizations.

[9/13/2001]
Version 0.2.6.1 "Darkness over Manhatten"
  * Fixes a horrible bug in 0.2.6 which prevented downloads from working.
  (Debian bug #111950)

  * The translations should be back in the package again.  (d'oh!)
  (Debian bug #111904)

  * The default display is back to its usual configuration (oops)

  * An option now appears in the "UI Options" dialog for the default grouping.

  * The scrolling behavior of the line-editor should be more friendly.
  (it'll scroll by single characters to a greater extent)

[9/8/2001]
Version 0.2.6 "It's against my programming to impersonate a deity"
  * IMPORTANT NOTE: this version will not compile on potato.  If anyone
  cares about this, I can patch the code to not compile themes on
  potato.  (the problem is that a feature I use to load themes isn't
  available in potato's libapt)  Alternatively, some brave soul could
  patch aptitude to load themes using potato's libapt...

  * Released despite the fact that 0.2.5.3 is not yet in testing.  From
  my glances at the testing bot's output, the problem is that the deity
  people are being lazy and not fixing RC bugs, which (since aptitude depends
  on a version of apt not in testing) is preventing the new apt from going
  into testing (which would break deity in testing).  And aptitude can't go
  into testing without the new apt.  Blah.
    By the time deity-devel fixes their bugs and gets recompiles for all archs
  and so on, this will be ready for testing.  I would have uploaded it a
  long time ago, had I realized what would happen.

  * This version adds support for externally defined package hierarchies,
  one of the major original goals of aptitude.
    As usual, this turned out to integrate less well into the program than
  I had hoped.  Fixing this will probably require another tree-class rewrite,
  and I think I'll aim at fixing it in 0.4.x.  Anyway, though, the basic
  stuff is there.  A lot of the work, actually, was in a massive and concerted
  attempt to make a first-cut hierarchy of all the packages in sid.  This
  was successful, in the limited sense that such a hierarchy now exists (and
  is distributed with the program)  However, it has many problems and
  even some inconsistencies.  Further work on that front is needed.

    The hierarchy stuff is documented in README.hier.  If you are an APT
  frontend author, please be aware that it is trivial to implement, and a
  (slow) generic implementation is available in src/generic/pkg_hier.{cc,h}.
  (this is currently the implementation used by aptitude itself)
    In other words: I want to encourage people to use this mechanism.

    If you are interested in helping improve the categorizations, I suggest
  using the internal category editor (press "E" while viewing packages)  The
  Vertical-Split layout is particularly useful for this.

    Efficiency is somewhat of a concern with this code; however, if you do
  not use it, it is my hope that it will never affect your use of the program.

  * In addition, there is slightly hacky support for a "flat package browser".
  This goes hand-in-hand with the above change, as I found that complex
  hierarchies were actually harder (for my little mind :) ) to navigate using
  aptitude's traditional tree-based approach.  Do "New Categorical Browser"
  from the "Views" menu to try this out.

  * The screen layout may now be configured by the user.  This is
  currently only available by editing configuration files, and is
  undocumented (because it's complicated, and I may change the format
  for a few revisions while I'm trying to figure out the best way
  of doing things)  See $prefix/share/aptitude/aptitude-defaults for
  some examples.

  * "Theming support" is available.  A "theme" is basically a collection
  of settings that makes aptitude behave and look differently.  The only
  themes available are "Vertical-Split" (highly recommended by me for wide
  consoles or xterms, especially if you're editing package hierarchies), and
  "Dselect" (not particularly useful even if you are a dselect junkie)

  * Aptitude::UI::Default-Grouping is now documented, and will not be
  used to set the grouping of a preview screen (bug #110704)

  * Aptitude::UI::Package-Header-Format is now documented.

  * Colors can be defined as being bold.  This cleans out a lot of evil
  cruft.

  * A 'short priority' column is now available (added to support a
  dselect theme)

  * autoclean-on-update works again.  (bug #108565)

  * ~ahold works again.  (bug #111466)

  * Several bugs in the table layout code were fixed; it should behave much
  more sanely now.

  * If aptitude (God forbid!) crashes or is killed with a catchable signal,
  it will now properly shut the display down instead of leaving it in a
  screwy state.

  * Fixed building on ia64 (old nasty debug code was breaking it)

  * Deleted the note in the README about "Save Options"

  * The configuration is now saved to config.new and moved to config using
  rename(2).  This should guard better against problems with the save process.

  * Subtree names in small windows are no longer clipped to one character
  too short.

  * Updated my mailing address in README and AUTHORS to @debian.org.

[8/6/2001]
Version 0.2.5.3 "I hate build errors"
  * getopt_long returns an int, not a char.  This caused signedness problems
  on powerpc.
  * time() and difftime() are in time.h.  This caused compile problems
  on the Hurd; it seems they were accidentally implicitly included on other
  platforms.
  * "make dist" no longer generates the ChangeLog automatically from RCS
  entries.  This means that I'll have to maintain it manually, but that
  REALLY beats having to download the full log for every file over a phone
  line every time I release a new version.

[7/27/2001]
Version 0.2.5.2 "Dashing away with a smoothing iron"
  * Fix an endianess problem that caused crashes on Alpha (among others)
  (Debian bug #106588)

[7/24/2001]
Version 0.2.5.1 "Hand me the brown paper bag, nurse!"
  * Using a widget with a history list no longer segfaults the program.
  Lesson of the day: never assume that a change is benign even if it couldn't
  possibly cause any problems!  (Debian bug #106378)

[7/23/2001]
Version 0.2.5 "Drop the text editor and back away slowly"
  * Multi-CD installs now work.  (Debian bug #104236)

  * Mouse support added.  Doesn't do much now, but the menus and buttons will
  work with it, and you can double-click packages to see information on them.

  * The download list can be scrolled left and right using the left and right
  arrow keys.

  * Line-editors can now have a history list.  (used when entering search and
  limit terms, grouping mechanisms, and sorting policies)

  * The prompt to enter a search term now defaults to an empty string; press
  up or Control-P to recall the previous term.

  * The 'set group' command now displays the current group as a default
  entry.  (Debian bug #103962)

  * The Minesweeper help screen should really work this time.

  * The Install/Remove menu item does the same thing as pressing 'g' when
  a preview is selected.

  * Added a line at the top of the screen listing some important keybindings,
  and removed the welcome dialog.  The welcome dialog was annoying, and
  extensive user testing (consisting of me watching over my sister's shoulder
  for about 5 minutes) revealed that people don't bother to read the
  keybinding information in it anyway.  (Debian bug #104483)

  * The primary Undo keybinding (ie, the one displayed in the menu) is now
  C-u, not C-_.

[7/19/2001]
Version 0.2.4 "C++ standard?  What C++ standard?"
  * aptitude compiles with g++-3.0.  (Debian bug #104723)
  * help-fi.txt is now in CVS (it was in the distribution tar.gz, but never
  got added to CVS.  Go figure)

[7/11/2001]
Version 0.2.3 "Curse you, Peter Pan!"
  * Finally, a new version..unfortunately, aptitude 0.2.2 needs two more days
  to get into testing, and I'm going to be gone in a few days.  I want to
  upload this version significantly before the freeze, since it fixes some
  bugs and could also add some that'll have to be squashed.  So I'm going to
  say farewell to my dreams of 0.2.2 in testing, and upload this.  Maybe I
  should increase the urgency, I really don't want the version in testing
  to be released with woody.

  * This version of aptitude should compile on Progeny Linux and on potato.

  * aptitude can now attempt to automatically su to the root user when
  running as a non-root user.  Treat this with some care, as it's a fairly
  complex and new feature -- ie, there are probably bugs and unexpected
  behavior lurking in it.

    However, this should provide an escape route in "OMG, I just spent an hour
  picking programs to install and forgot I wasn't root!" situations.

  * aptitude now supports some command-line options, see "man aptitude" for
  details.

  * "status bar" downloads aren't any more; "split-screen" is more
  accurate.  They display the currently active items and leave out the
  history of past downloads.

  * With any luck, the media-change message should now fit on one line.
  This still doesn't handle the case where the CD name is longer than the
  screen width, but I hope it'll do for now.

  * Pressing "q" while a 'status bar' download is in progress now stops it.

  * If the package list is resized so that the selection would be off the
  screen, the selection will now be preserved. (Debian bug #103963)

  * A package description with a word which is longer than the screen width
  will no longer crash aptitude.  (Debian bug #103691)

  * Broken dependencies now have a visual marking other than color.
  (Debian bug #79047)

  * If the menubar autohides and the user opted to be able to close all
  screens without exiting the program, force the menu to be visible
  anyway if no screens are active. (Debian bug #102918)

  * Fixed bugs that prevented the "utils" and "hamradio" sections from having
  descriptions displayed.

  * If you try to start aptitude as root while the apt cache is locked, it
  will open the cache read-only. (previously it just refused to run at all)

  * A limit type based on the action to be taken with a package
  (install/upgrade/remove/purge/reinstall/hold) is now available.
  (Ted Tso's suggestion, no bug #)

  * The 'action' keys can now advance the cursor to the next item at the
  current level.  They won't advance into subtrees or out of the current
  subtree; this is because it's nontrivial for me to move to the "next"
  subtree due to the design, and moving out of a subtree violates the
  Principle of Least Surprise (not to mention probably causing you to delete
  half your packages)  (Debian bug #104209)

  * Pressing '?' while playing Minesweeper will actually show a help screen
  now.

  * You can now run dpkg-reconfigure from within aptitude (it's a silly
  feature, but it's also about 10 lines of code..)

  * When aptitude starts for the first time, it will *not* mark every
  package as new.

[6/29/2001]
Version 0.2.2 "Finlandia"
  * The Finnish translations have been updated to work with 0.2.0.  This is
  the major change in this release.

  * Default widths can now be set by the translator, albiet in a slightly
  hacky way.  (you can translate a string of numbers to set them.  See
  pkg_columnizer.cc for a short description)

  * A short description of each section is now displayed next to the section
  itself.  This clutters things up a bit and may be modified or removed in
  a future release.

[6/28/2001]
Version 0.2.1 "Another Fine Mess"
  * Options are now automatically saved when you hit "OK".  Let's hope I was
  overly paranoid earlier about the possible consequences of this..

  * Installing from CD-ROMs works.  Amazingly, this worked perfectly in every
  release through 0.1.9 -- 0.2.0 broke it when I changed the semantics of
  popup_widget(), and I couldn't test it until I finally found a CD..

  * Minesweeper's dialog boxes (new game, etc) work.  (although pressing
  Enter while Cancel is selected does the Wrong Thing..)

  * The original behavior of the tree widgets has been restored: they only
  scroll one line at a time.  Personally, I find this to be much better; I
  hope you do too.

  * Really fixed the signedness issues with addch() this time.  (I hope..)

  * The ancient bug that caused the root of the tree to be hidden when you
  pressed End has been found and terminated (with extreme prejudice)

[6/25/2001]
Version 0.2.0 "Damn The Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead!"
  * Ok, it took a bit longer than I expected.  Sue me.

  This is the first version in the 0.2.0 "stable" series, where "stable"
means "working reasonably well".  User-visible changes from 0.0.x include:

  * The UI has been completely rewritten.  Several changes below
  follow from this, but in general it allowed the interface to become
  more flexible and dynamic.

  * aptitude now supports a split-screen display.  It isn't visible by
  default in all screens; press 'D' to show or hide it.

  * There is a global menubar.

  * The currently active views are arranged less like a stack: you can
  cycle between them or jump to a particular one.

  * 'x' no longer has any function.  You cannot say "revert all
  changes I made in this display", because with a non-stack display
  model, "all changes I made in this display" doesn't make sense.

  * You can read this document from within the program.

  * The program options can be modified from within the program.

  * You can configure the way in which packages are grouped and
  sorted.

  * You can play Minesweeper from within the program.

  * The download display has been entirely rewritten.  ie, it works
  now and isn't so much of a hack.

  * When a package is marked for installation, aptitude can now
  install the packages it recommends and/or suggests as well.

  * aptitude can now perform clean and autoclean operations.

  * much, much more.  (well, maybe not.  Do I look like I know?)

Changes from version 0.1.9:

  * Aptitude::UI::Prompt-On-Exit works again.

  * The extended description area can be hidden by default.

  * Autoclean actually works, rather than just saying that it works.

  * The menubar now automatically pops up the first menu, rather than
  doing this "select the menu name" thing.

  * It should now be possible to view the NEWS file from the Help
  menu.

  * Removed the Test Error.

  * Added src/vscreen/README.layout to the files which are included in
  the distribution.

  * You now get the extended description area, status line, and so on
  in all screens, even if you access them via a version item (oops)

  * The extended description no longer allows you to scroll off the bottom.

  * Fixed sorting, in an only slightly ugly way.  (the configurable
  sorting was only being applied to the first level of hierarchy)

  * Eight-bit characters should work again in vs_pager, I hope.

  * vscreen/ compiles with g++-3.0.
    The convention I'm now using for STL classes is this: header files
  should explicitly use "std::" to access them; .cc files should
  declare "using std" (AFTER all #includes!)

  * Several strings were still hard to translate because they were
  used in concatenation to produce a result.

  * Menu tweaks: the "o" in "Remove obsolete packages" is now
  highlighted.

  * Fixed some random deadlocks by using recursive mutexes.

  * Documentation updated, although not as much as I wanted to.

Pre-0.2.0 versions:
===============================================================================
[6/18/2001]
Version 0.1.9 "Speak Now Or Forever Hold Your Peace."
  * If there are no serious bug reports about this, APTITUDE 0.2 WILL
  BE UPLOADED TO UNSTABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE!  Therefore, if you know of
  a problem that should prevent this from being released into the wild,
  PLEASE TELL ME!  Thank you.

  * There is now a header which displays various useful information.

  * The views all display a header, description area, and status line.
  (previously only the main package list displayed them)

  * The status line now does something slightly more sensible when no package
  is selected.  Suggestions for further refinement welcome

  * Changing the status layout configuration now has an immediate effect.

  * You can now have a separate limit for preview screens
  (Aptitude::UI::Preview-Limit)

  * Various informational messages are displayed in the status line now if
  the "minibuffer interaction" option is set.

  * Package matchers for Origin and Archive are now available.

  * There is now an option ("Aptitude::UI::Welcome-Dialog") controlling
  whether the potentially annoying welcome dialog is displayed on startup.

  * Various potential crashes fixed, I hope.

[6/15/2001]
Version 0.1.8 "Making a List and Checking It Twice"
  * Viewing dependencies no longer causes Aptitude to enter an infinite loop

  * Added consistency checking: you can no longer perform an installation
  run if there are broken packages (the problem-resolver will run and you
  will be sent back to the preview screen)

  * Aptitude can now install Recommends and Suggests when a package is
  selected for installation.  (note, however, that libapt is a little screwy
  and seems to behave incorrectly if there is an OR in the Recommends: or
  Suggests: line.  I'll work up a proper bug report when I have a chance)

    This only works if Auto-Install is on.  Therefore:

  * Auto-Install IS NOW ON BY DEFAULT!  I think this should be fine, but people
  should be aware of this.

  * Aptitude can now perform the "autoclean" operation of apt-get.  It can
  also perform the "autoclean" operation automatically whenever packages are
  updated.  Addresses Debian bug #97653.

  THIS IS ON BY DEFAULT!
  If you think having it be on by default is bad, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!
  If you think having it be on by default is good, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!

  I have mixed feelings about this, because while naive users who just take
  the defaults will probably benefit from this, I feel that it violates the
  "principle of least surprise".

  * Reinstalled packages are no longer listed as broken in the preview screen.

  * Reinstalled packages and versions of reinstalled packages are colorized
  correctly.

  * Aptitude::Log is now documented.

  * Action logs are now sorted by type and package name.  In other words: it
  should now be possible to make sense of them.

  * Essential packages can be selected using a matcher.

  * Packages which are essential have a line saying "Essential: Yes" in
  their info screens.

  * Marking an essential package for removal is now difficult (if you can get
  the problem-resolver to do it, though, the program won't complain when you
  try to remove them.  I don't think the problem-resolver will ever do this,
  though..)  Addresses Debian bug #86115

  * Packages can be grouped and sorted by priority.

  * Cleaning the package cache gives more feedback.

  * Recommends and suggests are colored red if they are not met.

  * Certain trees (specifically package installation modes and priorities)
  now are sorted in a non-alphabetical order.  For instance, with priorities,
  the highest priority comes first, followed by the next-highest, and so on.

  * Fixed a crash when using ANDs in matching expressions.

[6/4/2001]
Version 0.1.7 "No."
  * Scrollbars should now be fixed in the popup pagers.  (there are still some
  visual artifacts, which I'm tempted to attribute to Curses bugs..)

  * A Minesweeper game is now available in aptitude, to liven up those long
  downloads.  Select "play Minesweeper" from the main menu..

  * Trying to repeat a search before a search has been performed no longer
  crashes the program.

  * Many more items added to the options menu and dialogs.  Internally we now
  use static tables to build the option dialogs, which should make it easier
  to add new options to them.

  * Fixed several small problems with the documentation of configuration
  options.

  * A popup window now appears for the entire time that aptitude is setting
  up after loading the cache.  (it currently says "loading cache")  The real
  solution is to make this not take so long, but..

  * NOTE: this version does NOT have the "don't let the user do something
  broken" code featured in 0.0.8.7.  With luck, 0.1.8 will have its own
  version of that logic.

[5/3/2001]
Version 0.1.6 "Are We There Yet?"
  * Merged with the stable branch through 0.0.8.6

  * File menu renamed to Actions (since that's what it is)

  * Undo re-enabled, and created an "Undo menu".  Note that undo no longer has
  the mark/revert behavior it used to -- in fact, it cannot, because the UI
  is no longer a strict stack (you can switch from one screen to another freely)

  * The README can now be viewed (from within the program) from the Help menu.

  * The menus and a lot more UI stuff should now be fully translatable.

  * Fixed a nasty little bug where undoing one action would make all
  auto-upgraded packages revert to being held.  (backported to 0.0.8.6)

  * When displaying a keybinding to the user, C-_ is displayed as C-_ rather
  than C-^?.

  * Information about the currently selected item is now displayed in the
  "status bar" style, with an additional "bold" attribute.  Makes it easier to
  tell apart from, say, an extended description.

  * Fixed some bugs in the logic for causing the download display to
  constantly stick to the end: in particular, the currently downloading
  item should now be on the bottom line of the screen rather than being
  off the bottom (and thus invisible)

  * If ~/.aptitude does not exst when the user selects "save options",
  it is now created.

[4/27/2001]
Version 0.1.5 "Will Debianize For Food"
  * All changelog entries which are really from 2001 are now listed as being
  from 2001.  However much I wish I could stop the forward march of time, I
  don't think that's the way to go about doing it.

  * Split-screen!  Ok, it's slightly hacky, unconfigurable, can't display
  anything besides the package description, and the bindings are quirky, but
  hey, the idea is there :)
    For lazy people :), 'D' shows/hides the description window and 'a' and 'z'
  move up/down in it.  'Tab' can be used to switch to it, at which point the
  usual navigation keys work.  At least, the ones I've implemented (up one line
  and down one line) work.

  * A precompiled matcher is now always used to perform searches.  This not
  only makes searches (hopefully) faster, it also prevents crashes when a bad
  search term is encountered a la bug #95455.

  * Packages which don't have an explicit source package listed should have
  a source package which has the same name as the package itself.  The info
  screen now makes use of this fact.

  * Exiting now saves the selection info again (there's not yet an
  "exit and discard changes" -- just Ctrl-C :-) )

[4/10/2001]
Version 0.1.4 "Once there was an Elephant, who tried to use the Telephant"
  * Merged with stable up through 0.0.8.3.

  * The multiplexer now jumps to the "previous" widget when the current
  one is destroyed.  The point of this is that the main aptitude display will
  act more or less like a stack again, which is a lot more convenient than how
  it was acting in 0.1.3.

  * The "Cancel" button displayed after downloading packages actually works.

  * When downloading stuff, the "saving extended information" progress
  bar is hidden.

  * The (non-minibuffer) download screens now have an "overall progress"
  indicator.

  * The status line now displays information about the currently
  selected menu item.

[3/23/2001]
Version 0.1.3 "South Blue Quickly"
  * Still a BETA DEVELOPMENT RELEASE.

  * Worked around a dumb autoconf bug.

  * Merged with stable updates through 0.0.8.0.

  * Added a match type for versions (~V)

  * Fixed a bug that caused the download-list to be updated at very
  irregular intervals.

  * Added a popup after the download that claims you can continue
  or cancel.  You can't.  But it's a nice thought anyway.  (see the first item)

  * Added sorting policies.  It was harder than it sounds.  See README.

[2/21/2001]
Version 0.1.2 "Erlknig"
  * Still a BETA DEVELOPMENT RELEASE.

  * How packages are grouped into the hierarchy can finally be configured!
  Currently there are only a few totally new options, but I'm sure people will
  find novel ways to brea^H^H^H^Hconfigure their systems.  Also, it's dead
  simple to add parsing for new policies (see load_config.cc and
  pkg_grouppolicy.cc)
    See the "GROUPING CONFIGURATION" section in the README for more information.

  * The download screen now scrolls automagically!  This closes one of the
  longest-standing and most just complaints about Aptitude. (TODO: add a
  scollbar widget -- not hard)

  * The "bytes downloaded" message shown when download completes now allows you
  to scroll the download screen behind it.  (TODO: display this as a "minibuffer"
  if the user requests it)

  * Synced with 0.0.7.15, fixes various minor issues and makes the default
  grouping more sane.

  * When you do a "forget new", the display is updated to reflect that fact.

  * Supposedly, package-info lines should be hidden when you perform a download.
  I'm not sure this actually works..

  * There's code to allow different sorting policies, not that you can actually
  use it.  (eg, sort by size..)

  * Divide-by-zero errors no longer randomly happen while you're downloading.

[1/30/2001]
Version 0.1.1 "Fool!  I told you the Electric Rubber Ducky Incident
               was never to be mentioned in my presence again!"
  * Still a BETA DEVELOPMENT RELEASE.

  * Updating package lists and installing packages is now possible!  This is
  still a little dicey and will improve in coming releases, but you can do it.

  * aptitude now compiles (and works) with APT 0.4, in addition to APT 0.3
    No 0.4 special features are explicitly supported yet.

  * configure.in now aborts if libsigc++ can't be found.

  * Keybindings for the current view were incorrectly active while the menu was
  being used.  Fixed.

  * You can now choose whether the menu should auto-hide, and by default it
  doesn't.

  * Searching for packages is again possible.  I've tried something that will
  hopefully make it less slow..

  * The apt package cache can be cleared from aptitude.

  * Various crashes fixed.

[12/3/2000]
Version 0.1.0 "Release without a name"
  * This is a BETA DEVELOPMENT RELEASE.  It is not fully functional yet; please
  use older versions if you need missing features.

  * The ui-rewrite tag finally belches forth a working binary!  Yes,
  aptitude 0.1.0 is here at last.  Changes are too numerous to really list, but:

  * vscreen is now a full widget library based on libsigc++, supporting real
  layout, signals/slots (of course), and..um..lots of other good stuff.  Look
  at the header files for more info (yes, I'll probably eventually fork it into
  another project)

  * this means that aptitude now depends (build and runtime) on libsigc++0.
    Sorry, potato users :(

  * On the plus side, we finally have a (links-style) menubar.

  * User-specific options (in ~/.aptitude/config) are supported, and can be
  explicitly saved by the user.

  * The new version doesn't handle small terminals so well yet (and resizing
  an xterm will cause a segfault!)

===============================================================================
Pre-0.1.0 versions begin here:

[6/8/2001]
Version 0.0.8.7.1 "D'oh"
  * The limit of the preview screen can once again be modified.  Thanks to
  Michael Politowski for pointing out a simple typo.

[6/4/2001]
Version 0.0.8.7 "Home from the Hospital"
  * Displaying information about a particular package version will now use
  the description of THAT version.

  * Fixed some problems with the autotools suite.

  * If the user's selections in the preview screen mean that something has
  to be fixed-up, the program now does the fixing and presents another preview.
  This addresses the following Debian bugs: #87774, #96559.  It may not fully
  close them; I am not certain whether the problem in those bugs is that I
  am incorrectly displaying the state of the packages, or that the problem
  resolver is doing stuff behind the user's back.
    Note: this is NOT forward-ported to version 0.1.x; this code is different
  enough in that track that I'll have to come up with a solution separately.

[5/3/2001]
Version 0.0.8.6 "Groundhog Day"
  * Really don't save extended state info if that info was modified (I thought
  this worked in 0.0.8.4, but, doh, I actually had done it in the unstable
  branch)

  * Hitting "purge" on a package version now does the expected.
  (Debian buf #96228, reported by the same JP)

[5/1/2001]
Version 0.0.8.5 "Bring Me A Shrubbery!"
  * Fixed two bugs relating to translations, reported by the ever-vigilant
  Michal Politowski:
     - Reran gettextize so that translations get installed with usable names.
     (Debian bug #95749)
     - Changed "purge" to "purged" when it is used to describe a package's
     current state.  (this lets translators distinguish between them, and is
     probably better anyway) (Debian bug #95867)

[4/27/2001]
Version 0.0.8.4 "I hate finals"
  * aptitude now only saves its extended state information if that information
  was modified (Debian bug #93135, reported by JP Sugarbroad <taral@taral.net>)

  * Don't segfault when the user searches while the cursor is on the last
  item in the tree.  (Debian bug #95495, reported by
  Len Sorensen <lsorense@opengraphics.com>)

  * Added description of action/state flags to online help and README.
  (Debian bug #93216, reported by Piotr Krukowiecki <piotr@pingu.ii.uj.edu.pl>)

  PS - debian bug #90909, referenced below, dealt with a crash that occured when
  updating the package lists while viewing information about a package.  Sorry
  for the overly terse entry.

[4/5/2001]
Version 0.0.8.3 "Palindrome"
  * Fix Debian bug #90909, reported by Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe@orcus.priv.at>
    This bug was due to the fact that I inexplicably overrode an important
  method to do nothing.

  * Added a Galacian manpage and help file.
   Thanks go to Jacobo Tarrio <jtarrio@iname.com>.

[3/23/2001]
Version 0.0.8.2 "Midterms suck"
  * Fix compile problems with apts in the 0.3 series.  (this one was actually
  tested with 0.3, so there)

[3/18/2001]
Version 0.0.8.1 "Do you know how hard it is to come up with dozens of
                 clever and witty release names?  I bet you don't!  I bet
                 no-one even reads these!  I bet it doesn't matter if I rant
                 for pages and pages and pages about teapots in the sky!"
  * Fixed a long-standing but undetected bug.  It turns out that some packages
  exist in the database but aren't available (they are called into existence by,
  for instance, a dependency on a non-existant package)  But aptitude was storing
  "sticky" state information for these packages.  This had a number of
  subtle but potentially startling consequences; among them is the
  fact that if a package of that name was eventually uploaded to the
  archive, it wouldn't show up as "new".

[3/16/2001]
Version 0.0.8.0 "Roll over, roll over.."
  * Galician translations, thanks to Jacobo Tarrio <jtarrio@iname.com>.
   (is it a sign that your program is popular when people translate it to
   languages you've never heard of?  Thank God for web1913 :) )

  * Spent a few minutes figuring out how to do (non-sticky, sorry) installation
   of a particular version.  Finally those version lists do what they oughta!
   More or less.

  * Incremented the third digit of the version.  Please don't laugh.

[3/04/2001]
Version 0.0.7.19 "Jubjub"
  * help-pl.txt is really installed.
  * Don't print spurious errors when the user enters blank patterns.
  * The "search again" binding now really has two values instead of just one.

[3/03/2001]
Version 0.0.7.18 "Jabberwocky"
  * Retroactively corrected NEWS entries which were in '00 but should have been
   in '01.
  * Fixed bugs reported by Michal Politowski <mpol@charybda.icm.edu.pl>
    - Accented characters in the status line are no longer displayed
     incorrectly (a stupid sign-extension bug)
    - Fixed a few cases of overeager marking of strings for translation.
    - Fixed three crashes in the parsers for matchers and limits
  * Entering an invalid limit will no longer occasionally cause dozens of
   errors.
  * Gave in and made "n" an alternate binding for "search again".
  * Added Polish translation, contributed by Michal Politowski.

[2/24/2001]
Version 0.0.7.17 "I will not make a stupid Brown Paper Bag reference here"
  * Fixed a horribly STUPID bug in the APT 0.5 support, involving me misreading
   the prototype of VersioningSystem::CheckDep and passing the arguments
   in reverse order from what it expected!  Oops.

[2/23/2001]
Version 0.0.7.16 "Brought to you by the letter F"
  * Added two new translations:
    - Finnish, contributed by Jaakko Kangasharju <ashar@iki.fi>
    - French, contributed by Martin Quinson <mquinson@ens-lyon.fr>

  * Made some formerly untranslatable strings in load_config.cc translatable
   (thanks to Jaakko for pointing this out)

  * configure.in now hacks around brokenness in some autoconf releases
  that caused C++ code to break.

[2/01/2001]
Version 0.0.7.15 "Coda"
  * Fixed a whole slew of bugs that Zack Weinberg <zackw@stanford.edu> was
  unfortunate to run into simultaneously:
    - Running into an error while loading the configuration no longer causes
     the program to panic and display a blank "we couldn't start successfully"
     screen.
    - Keybinding subgroups don't cause a spurious error message.
    - If startup isn't successful (and thus the package file wasn't read),
     trying to exit no longer causes a crash.  (just in case, added checks in
     several other places for NULL pointers as well)
    - The bindings for vs_tree (Aptitude::UI::Keybindings::Tree) can now also
     be reconfigured from the toplevel, as expected.

[12/18/2000]
Version 0.0.7.14 "Grouping therapy"
  * Suggestions and patches from Arto Jantunen <viiru@debian.org>:
    - Tasks are now displayed as a separate "section"
    - The hierarchy has been 'inverted'.  The primary grouping mechanism is now
     the 'subsection', with the 'top section' above it.
    - Redundant hierarchy such as "virtual/virtual" is no longer there.
    - the online help explains about the 'f' key.
  * Various bugs, crashes, and bad behavior with APT 0.4 thrashed out.

[12/12/2000]
Version 0.0.7.13 "Portage"
  * aptitude should now compile without modifications against APT 0.4.  The
  fancy new features won't be used and will probably never be hooked into this
  branch -- the long-vapoured (but still slowly approaching) rewritten version
  will be where I fiddle with that stuff.

[11/27/2000]
Version 0.0.7.12 "Bored in Providence"
  * The long-standing TODO item of allowing a single package to be installed
   without affecting anything else is more-or-less fixed, although I'm not
   sure if it's the best implementation (actually, I'm sure it probably has
   unfortunate glitches still..)  Press "I" and read about it in the README
   (although I should clear that documentation up..)

[11/26/2000]
Version 0.0.7.11 "My Grandma, what big Segfaults you have!"
  * Fix a long-standing bug that triggered a segfault-on-start in extremely
   unusual circumstances (which is how it avoided me for so long)

[11/26/2000]
Version 0.0.7.10 "I didn't do it!  No-one saw me do it!"
  * Errr...the changes in the last version included a hack to make packages
   appear in the right indentation from the left-hand side of the screen.  This
   hack also happened to cause the program to misbehave very badly in some
   circumstances (eg, when trying to download packages)  I've replaced it with
   a more invasive hack that actually works.  Oh, and I tested it this time.
   Testing things is a good idea..

[11/25/2000]
Version 0.0.7.9 "YOW!  I've been LAID OUT by a COLUMN GENERATOR!"
  * The only change in this release is a total rewrite of the column-generation
  code.  It's much less crufty and should allocate space more cleverly on
  larger displays. (this also fixes a debbts report)
    The column configuration is slightly different; if you have a custom
  configuration, you might want to check the README.

[11/22/2000]
Version 0.0.7.8 "Silence of the Turkeys"
  * Fixed a minor typo in the README reported in the Debian BTS.
  * Similarly, fixed a small interface bug with the package-limit string.
  * Finally got around to adding the delete-to-end-of-line and
   delete-to-beginning-of-line functions to the line-editor.
  * Logs of install runs now display (for upgraded packages) the version being
   upgraded from and the version being upgraded to.

[10/27/2000]
Version 0.0.7.7 "Pentecost"
  * More translations (es_ES and pt_BR) added.  Thanks to
   Jorge Carrasquilla Soares and Douglas Moura Ferreira for contributing
   these.

[10/15/2000]
Version 0.0.7.6 "Package Management for Pern"
  * Debian bug #74788 fixed: threads are eliminated if not available, allowing
   aptitude to compile on the Hurd.  (go Hurders!)

[10/13/2000]
Version 0.0.7.5 "Friday the 13th"
  * Fixed the bug reported by Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>, where "x"
   had its view of its arguments backwards.  (this was introduced by the change
   in 0.0.7.2 which altered the messages displayed when saving as an
   unprivileged user)

[10/11/2000]
Version 0.0.7.4 "Ich bin ein Berliner!"
  * corrected German translations.  Hopefully .de users won't mind no longer
   being amused by my fractured Deutsch.  Thanks to Sebastian Schaffert
   for contributing these.

  * Masato Taruishi has contributed a patch to internationalize even more
   strings (it is even possible to have language-specific online help,
   although no internationalized help files are written yet)  He also
   updated the Japanese translation to reflect this.  (the German translation,
   unfortunately, continues to lag behind)

[10/3/2000]
Version 0.0.7.3 "If I only had a brain"
  * aptitude now REALLY has a manpage.  (if it doesn't get installed by
   "make dist", it's not in the program..)

[9/23/2000]
Version 0.0.7.2
  * "Bug-reports keep fallin' on my head"

  * aptitude now has a manpage.

  * The program now works properly with local files (this was a problem
   that arose from my abuse of libapt)

  * If aptitude is run as an unprivileged user, pressing "q" and "x" no longer
   mention saving anything.

  * Merged in an i18n patch (thanks to Masato Taruishi for this and the
   Japanese translation)  There is a German translation done by me, but
   given the state of my German, a native speaker may want to send me
   a corrected translation.

[8/03/2000]
Version 0.0.7.1
  * "Faster than a speeding river of molasses" release.

  * The lengthy hiatus here was due to the fact that I was originally
   planning to fix a bunch of cruft and release quickly towards the
   beginning of the summer <sarcastic laughter>  Then I decided to rewrite
   the UI in a branch in CVS.  That's not done, but the more braindead
   mistakes really ought to be fixed, and should have been back in May when
   I found them...

  * Aptitude can now generate a simple logfile when doing a dpkg run
   (and optionally pipe it into a command)  It's not much (it should really
   be sorted, or at least include more info), but it can help with "err, what
   were those 500 packages I just upgraded?" situations :-)

  * Column-formatting uses printf-style %-escapes instead of the old
   method.

  * Fixes the "DOH, lockfiles don't go in /" bug.

  * file: URLs (ie, local package repositories) now work.

[4/18/2000]
Version 0.0.7
  * The segfault that plagued 0.0.6.9 seems to be gone.  Thanks go to
   Panu Hllfors <panupa@iki.fi> for helping me narrow the problem down.
   Please let me know if you encounter similar problems (or, indeed, any
   problems :) ).

     The following changes were in 0.0.6.9 but not mentioned (oops):

  * Wrote a proper help screen, so you don't get the full README when you press
   '?'.  We still don't have a mechanism for dynamically adjusting the display
   based on keybindings, but this should make things somewhat nicer for
   newbies.

[4/9/2000]
Version 0.0.6.9
  *  This version introduces undo capabilities.  You can undo any number of
    actions on packages (install, remove, etc--even "forget new")  See the
    manual for details.

  *  As a result, there are now two ways to quit: "q" quits and saves changes,
    and "x" quits and discards changes.

  *  Major restructuring of the directory tree.  The toplevel now contains only
    code for aptitude itself--low-level UI stuff is in vscreen/ and generic
    useful routines (eg, the apt-cache wrapper) are in generic/

  *  Major changes to the keybinding code; keybindings are now mostly shared
    between the different contexts they occur in, with the ability to override
    a keybinding in a particular context.

  *  Added some alternative keybindings (vi-style and others), by popular
    request.

  *  Reorganized the TODO list and added a bunch of stuff to it.

  *  Searching now handles virtual packages

  *  Limiting on package names no longer segfaults

  *  Columns with nothing to display should display a placeholder value
    (eg, "<none>") instead of simply being blank.

  *  Fixed various problems with detecting and flagging broken dependencies

  *  Fixed various problems with the handling and displaying of OR groups

  *  Reverse dependencies which occur because of Provides are now displayed
    correctly.

  *  There is no longer a default binding for just displaying a package's
    description; "i" will display the full information screen by default.
    (it's just as easy to see the description this way, and you get more
     information as well)  The old behavior can be regained by binding
    Description to "i": 'Aptitude::UI::Keybindings::Description "i";' in
    /etc/apt/apt.conf  (you may need to remove the binding for InfoScreen
    as well)

  *  Various segfaults when trying to get information about virtual packages
    were fixed.

  *  You can now perform a package-list update or an install run from any apt
    tree, not just a package list (or at least you should be able to)  Of course,
    if the package you are viewing vanishes from the cache as a result, you will
    be sent back to where you came from.

  *  Added a match type, ~c, which matches removed packages with conffiles
    remaining on the system.

  *  You can now easily toggle the display of column headers at runtime by
    pressing "h".

2/06/2000
Version 0.0.6a
  *  Fixed a rather embarassing compile error that got into 0.0.6.

2/06/2000
Version 0.0.6
  *  Greatly improved search capabilities.  You can now match on many different
    attributes of a package, and combine search terms into complex expressions.
    This is used both for searching and implementing "display limits", which
    act as a filter for the visible list of packages.  See README for details.

  *  Added commands to expand and collapse an entire tree of packages.

  *  Searches now have a 'wraparound' behavior.

  *  Actually set up a binding for Refresh, handle it globally.

  *  Made the display of broken packages more uniform.

  *  Fixed a problem that caused packages to be put on hold when you cancelled
    a removal or an install.

  *  Pressing "hold" on a package which can't be upgraded now /toggles/ the
    sticky-hold state (it was hard to turn it off previously)

  *  Fixed another dependency-OR handling bug which caused OR lists to appear
    to include the first package before the list.

  *  Changed the install-preview screen to more correctly packages whose state
    was changed by fixing broken dependencies.  Packages which are being
    installed or deleted for this reason get their own trees.

  *  The amount of padding after a column can now vary by column and is
    configurable.

  *  Errors now use a single color definition, and are white on red.

  *  You can now download and view the Changelog for a package (not perfect
    yet: you get HTML cruft, not all packages work (that I may not be able
    to fix) )

  *  Fixed a bug which caused problems with displaying errors.

  *  Added column types for the section and priority.

  *  Added a minimal online-help system (just displays the README)

  *  Internal change (not used yet): the vscreen main loop now supports the
    registration of timers.  (configure with --with-periodic-beep to
    enable a really annoying beep at one-second intervals)

  *  Internal change: the status/header-lines and status widget handling of
    vs_tree were split into a new class, vs_minibuf_win.

  *  Internal change: vscreen::repaint no longer implicitly calls refresh.

  *  Internal change: the code to orchestrate downloads moved to
    download.{cc,h}

1/19/2000
Version 0.0.5
  *  This release has a lot of bugfixes, column formatting support, and a
    greatly fixed status-line editor.

  *  Sanitized and made consistent a lot of arbitrary decisions about what
    version to use when looking statistics up about a package.  The function
    pkg_item::visible_version() handles this.

  *  You can now get package information by pressing Enter while a particular
    version of a package is selected.  Information about that version will
    be displayed.

  *  Don't crash if the user tries to update the package lists while not root
    or while another apt is running.  (oops..)

  *  The preview screen *should* separate out packages which can't be upgraded
    because of broken dependencies.

  *  Broken versions weren't being displayed with a "broken" color; fixed.

  *  Throttle the update frequency of the progress bars; previously I was
    updating as quickly as possible, which lead to a massive loading up of the
    system.  This change greatly improved startup times.

  *  libncurses5 sometimes sends KEY_RESIZEs -- don't assert their absence
    anymore, just ignore them :)

  *  column support!  Configurable!  This is really the major feature in this
    release; see the README for more

  *  Overhauled the status-line editing widget to fix a lot of small bugs and
    greatly improve editing.

  *  Added a single keystroke to repeat the last search (bind something to
    ReSearch)

  *  At the request of omega@anomie.dhis.net, added a status tree for obsolete
    packages.

1/10/2000
Version 0.0.4a
  *  "Faster than a speeding bullet" release.  (I really am starting to regret
    trying to come up with clever names for releases. :) )

  *  Had a sudden flash of inspiration and added the three-line fix needed to
    hack around libncurses5's leaveok() brokenness.

1/10/2000
Version 0.0.4
  *  "New Year's Resolution" release.  I actually managed to fix everything
    which I claimed I would, but I've resolved never to promise to fix
    something in the next release again.  Even to myself. ;-)  Also, I want
    to release versions more often..

  *  Aptitude now tries to Do The Right Thing with regard to the dselect
    state of a package by adjusting its own state when the dselect state
    changes in between runs.  This prevents the really bad problems I
    experienced.

  *  The interface coloration is now configurable (see README for details)

  *  More information is available in the download screen -- the actual amount
    of data dowloaded for each item and an estimated time to completion (for
    everything) are displayed.

  *  Compiles against libncurses5, although there's an annoying visual bug when
    using libncurses5 that I can't get rid of (leaveok doesn't seem to hide
    the cursor anymore..)

  *  Fixed the bug which caused ORs in dependencies to apparently continue
    forever (that is, "Depends: libc6, mutt | mail-reader, libncurses4" would
    be displayed as "Depends: libc6, mutt | mail-reader | libncurses4")

  *  Rewrote the various messages and interaction involving the status line
    to be done the Right Way[tm].

  *  Aptitude now (by default) displays what changes will be made -- that
    is, which packages will be installed, removed, etc, before
    performing a package run -- press the "install packages" key again to
    continue.

  *  Setting Aptitude::Auto-Install to true will cause dependencies of a
    package to automatically be marked for installation when you select it to
    be installed.

  *  Aptitude now (by default) attempts to resolve missing dependencies and
    fix broken packages before doing an install run.  To disable this, set
    "Aptitude::Fix-Broken" to false.

  *  A screen with all information about the package collected into one
    location is now available (by default, you can access it by pressing
    Enter while a package is selected)

  *  Finally got rid of the visual bug that caused non-selectable things to
    appear selected (I fixed it by not displaying them as selected even when
    they are ;-) )

  *  Added descriptive headers to the version and dependency lists.

  *  Made the behavior of selections around non-selectable items much more
    logical.

  *  Package trees now display, in the header, an estimate of the number of
    bytes which will be downloaded and installed on the next package run.

  *  Packages can now be reinstalled.

  *  Removed a lot of the old test code.  The next release will probably (see
    my resolution :) ) rename "testscr.cc" to "main.cc".

  *  Documentation updates.  Rewrote aptitude-hackers-guide.txt to be less a
    file-by-file tour and more a high-level overview.

  *  Included a real CVS commit log (see ChangeLog)

12/20/1999
Version 0.0.3
  *  "Merry Christmas and a Happy Armageddon" release.  This'll probably be the
    last Aptitude release before the year 2000.  Assuming that civilization has
    not collapsed, expect to see another version early in the new year.
    (hopefully before potato freezes ;-) )  If not, I guess I'll have to start
    porting it to the abacus platform..

  *  Configurable keybindings!  Rejoice!  See README for more info and
    examples.

  *  aptitude now has persistent state, stored (by default) in
    /var/state/aptitude.

  *  This is used to implement some dselect-like capabilities, including
    'sticky' selections that persist across sessions and the ability to track
    new packages.  New packages are implemented in a manner entirely orthogonal
    to selection state, which means (in short words) that a package can
    remain "new" for an indefinite amount of time, even after it's installed.

  *  Two configuration options, Aptitude::Forget-New-On-Update and
    Aptitude::Forget-New-On-Install, are provided to automatically clear the
    list of new packages.

  *  As an unforunate side-effect, dselect selections are no longer inherited.
    The main reason is that I couldn't think of a clean way to save the
    package states into the dselect database (calling dpkg --set-selections
    should work, but you have to play with lockfiles then..)  And it's tricky
    in general to try to manage two almost-but-not-quite identical databases
    of info.
     This may come back in the next release if I can work out how to do it
    (but it'll probably be controlled by a flag and off by default)  On the
    other hand, it's not really needed unless you're trying to mix dselect
    and aptitude.

  *  The package list can be searched.  This occasioned at least one really
    nasty (but non-buggy!) hack, which I'll fix in the next release.  Currently
    *only* package lists (not version lists, etc) can be meaningfully searched,
    and searching only looks for substrings in the package name -- no
    regexps or checking of descriptions. (guess when this'll be fixed?)

  *  A progress bar is now available for initialization and so on

  *  Errors are displayed by the UI (needs a little work still, but
    functional..)

  *  An annoying resize bug in 0.0.2 was fixed -- if you resized the xterm
    during a download, everything would start to flicker.

  *  Various segfaults, crashes, hangs, and visual quirks were eliminated.

  *  This is the first release to get a tag in CVS! :)

12/5/1999
Version 0.0.2
  * aptitude can now download and install packages!  This means that it's
   now technically possible to use it in place of other package management
   tools, although it's still lacking some stuff that would make it a really
   useful program.  This is the major change, and the reason for the new
   release.
  * dselect selections are now inherited
  * short package descriptions are displayed in the status line of the package
   tree
  * you can mark package *versions* for installation and removal (sometimes)
  * broken dependencies should be visually flagged
  * Various other bugfixes and tweaks.

11/18/1999
Version 0.0.1  --  Very preliminary alpha version released for comment and/or
                   criticism.
